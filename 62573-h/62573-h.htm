<h2 id="CHAPTER_I">CHAPTER I<br />
<span class="smaller">KAIROUAN</span></h2>

<p>It was cold, but a glorious morning when I left by motor
for Kairouan. Soon the white houses of Tunis were left
behind. The sun was rising as we flung its outskirts behind
us, and the car headed for open country. Rocky hills
showed themselves on the horizon, and there were abrupt
peaks rising out of stretches of carefully cultivated vineyards,
orchards of olive trees, and broad fields just tinged
with the promise of early wheat. No walls, but occasional
cactus hedges. The road climbed a saddle of hill from
whence one could look back on the sea. A few houses
here and there, flat-roofed and built in the Moorish style,
were obviously the homes of the landowners. Not an
inch of ground seemed wasted. Arabs were already at
work behind their wooden ploughs, drawn either by horses,
mules, bullocks, or camels. These last looked as if they
were inwardly protesting against the indignity, and stalked
along with their usual disdainful air. After a time the
road led into wilder country, bare stretches covered only
with a sort of rough heathery plant, with scattered encampments
of Bedouins, their black tents surrounded by a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
zareba of piled thorns. At last we caught the gleam of the
white domes of Kairouan against the sky.</p>

<p>It lies in an open plain, and one’s first impression is of
its whiteness. White-washed mosques and tombs, white
flat-topped houses, enclosed in a high brown crenellated
wall. Once inside the gates, all touch of European atmosphere
is left behind. The city is Eastern to the core, “une
vraie ville arabe,” as Hassan said. It is one of the sacred
Moslem places and is a great centre for pilgrimages. The
chief mosque is Sidi-Okba, with its large courtyard and
numerous doorways leading into the interior, where in the
gloom one sees the roof supported by row after row of
Roman pillars. The effect in the vast emptiness is striking.
The existing structure is said to date from the ninth century,
and the builders must have ransacked ancient ruins for
their materials. Some of the columns are of red
porphyry, and the antique <i>minbar</i> or pulpit-chair is beautifully
carved in wood, but beyond this the decorations
are poor.</p>

<p>From the minaret in the courtyard there is a lovely view,
the holy city crouched below with the frequent bubbles
of its domed tombs and mosques, and beyond the wall, wide
spaces stretching to distant hills.</p>

<p>But the crowded streets and <i>souks</i>, or covered arcades,
were the chief attraction of Kairouan. Nearly all the men
wore a burnous with a hood that came over the head. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
women did not wear the ugly face covering seen in Tunis,
but they were so closely wrapped in voluminous black or
white draperies that they looked like walking bundles.
Occasionally an eye peered out from amongst the folds,
but one wondered how they could see to make their way.
Bedouin women strode past, good-looking and haughty,
their head-covering thrown back showing their tattooed
faces, their necks covered with coins; whilst the blue of
their robes made a pleasant note of colour. Their men
were tall and sinewy with hawk features, and they wore
their sand-coloured burnous like dispossessed princes.
Here and there one saw the vivid green cloak or turban of
some holy man who had done the journey to Mecca, or
there was a splash of madder or burnt orange; but for the
most part the crowd was neutral-tinted. Everything,
buildings, streets, mosques, and crowds, was drenched in
a glow of sunlight. Even the shadows seemed warm and
throbbing. The market-place was the great centre, and
here it was almost difficult to push through the throng.
Men in grave and dignified draperies sat outside the
cafés, drinking from tiny handleless cups and smoking
meditatively.</p>

<p>I said the place was untouched by modernism, but I
must confess that they were usually listening with grave
pleasure to a gramophone reproduction of the voices of
their own singers! It was fortunate when it kept to that.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
I was sketching one morning near a café, and through my
absorption I became aware of the gramophone giving
piercing shrieks and discoursing in a high-pitched woman’s
voice. It began to worry me. “What on earth is that
record, Hassan?” I asked impatiently, and was appalled
at the ready response that it was a Jewess adding to the
numbers of Israel! Needless to say, Hassan did not use
such a roundabout way of expressing himself. I cast a
swift glance at the Arab audience. Impassively they sat,
sipping their coffee, and it was impossible to tell what they
were thinking of. But Hassan assured me it was a favourite
record and most amusing; I hastily became very busy
with my painting.</p>

<p>Ali Hassan was my guide in Kairouan and showed an
intelligent interest in points of view to sketch. He was
a portly Arab, disinclined to exert himself, so the job just
suited him. And he spoke French well. He told me he
had been born in Kairouan but that he was a travelled
man. Had he not been to Tunis, to Algiers, and even to
Marseilles? He claimed kinship with nearly every person
in Kairouan and this proved a great asset. When I expressed
a wish to see the women’s Turkish Baths, “That
is easily done,” said he, “for is not the Keeper of the Baths
my mother-in-law?” As we passed the outer door he
thrust his head in and called to her to come forth. I pushed
open a second door, and an old wrinkled crone appeared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
in a cloud of steam and led me through the various rooms.
None of the bathers seemed the least embarrassed at my
sudden appearance, but greeted me with smiles as I picked
my way through the puddles of water and the pale olive
of nude limbs. There were family parties of mothers and
daughters and even tiny babies of a few months old, all
chattering happily together and plastering themselves
with a kind of grey clay. The outer room, where all the
clothes were left, was in charge of a girl of fifteen or so,
and here were numerous clients in various stages of cooling-off.
Arab women in the towns go to the baths two or
three times a week, so it is pleasant to feel that the people
under the black shrouds that one meets in the streets,
are at least clean.</p>

<p>On cold days when Hassan sat huddled in his white
burnous by my campstool, looking like an elderly and
discontented Father Christmas, it was usually not long
before one of his invaluable relatives appeared bringing
him a cup of coffee. “The waiter at the Snake Charmer’s
café is my sister’s son,” remarked Hassan, complacently
sipping, whilst I mused on the vista of relationships opened
up by a plurality of wives. I had already met two uncles,
two mothers-in-law, five or six of his children, a wife and
a nephew. How many more were there? Soon I wanted
a small boy to pose in the foreground of my picture. “I
will fetch one of my sons,” remarked the conjuror, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
walked across the street, returning with a most unwilling
small child. “And it is not necessary to give him anything.
The sight of money makes the eye greedy,” said
his father, peacefully relapsing into the folds of his cloak
whilst I settled to work.</p>

<p class="caption">Kairouan</p>
</div>

<p>Were one to sit for long at the doorway of the Baths,
facing the gate of the city, one would see the whole world
of Kairouan pass through in the course of the day. It
was New Year’s day, and every one was abroad. A
deputation of notable townspeople came through the old
gateway on their way to present a New Year’s Resolution
to someone or something. Their full flowing robes made a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
picture of the procession, and I sighed at the thought of
the top hats and glittering watch chains of England.</p>

<p>Then came three old and venerable men clad in snowy
white, two of them supporting the footsteps of the most
aged. He was the Kaïd, the authority in Mussulman
law, and was nearly ninety.</p>

<p>It was a fête day too at my tiny hotel, and the proprietor
supplied ‘champagne’ with a generosity more
apparent than real. There was much toasting and making
of speeches amongst the small bourgeois who formed
the clientèle; and a baby of two was given long sips of
champagne by a humorous father, who then acted the
part of a waiter with a napkin over his arm, to the intense
amusement of his feminine belongings. The rôle suited
him admirably. Doubtless Mrs. Noah and the young
Shem, Ham and Japhet were also convulsed with mirth
in their day at a similar buffoonery played by the head
of the family. Jokes die hard.</p>

<p>The military quarters, the Government building, and
the hotel were all outside the city gates and provided with
small public gardens, full of the green of palms, of pepper
trees, of oleanders. A few trees were planted down some
of the streets of the tiny modern quarter; but it all ended
as abruptly as if a line were ruled across it. Beyond were
sand and cactus hedges and roads that led to the horizon.
There is something attractive about French colonial quarters<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
however small. They are so trim and neat and provided
with the shade of eucalyptus trees, mimosas and anything
that will grow in a sandy soil.</p>

<p>Close to the Gate Djelladine was the Snake Charmer’s
café and the sound of a native drum and the squeal of a
pipe led my steps there one day. He and the two musicians
were squatting on a small raised platform at the end of
the low room and I as a European was given the doubtful
privilege of a place in the front row where my knees were
pressed against the platform. The charmer was a strange
looking man with a thin wild face, dressed in a striped
burnous and wearing nothing on his mop of long black
hair. On the floor in front of him lay a bag of sacking
that stirred and moved. After the room had filled up with
a crowd of Arabs and the music had been going on for
some time, he opened the mouth of the sack and from an
inner jar pulled out a large cobra. This he began to tease,
dancing in front of it, flapping his long hair at it and tapping
its tail with a stick. Naturally annoyed, it reared
up ready to strike, but the constant movement of the man
seemed to daze it. It struck at him once or twice as he
swayed and danced in front of it but he took care to keep
just out of range. Then he brought a young snake out
of the bag, and this sat up too and tried to look like its
mother. Meanwhile there was dead silence in the room,
except for the drone of the music and the thud of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
charmer’s bare feet as he danced. Every eye was fixed
on him, the Arab waiter with a tray of coffee in his hands
stood motionless, staring, and the dark faces of the audience
watched with the intent unblinking gaze of an eastern
race. Again the man dived into the bag and brought out
a yellow snake which he lowered by the tail into his open
mouth, then laughing wildly he took it out and wound it
round his head where it looked like a horrible chaplet in
the midst of his rough hair, its head pointing out over
his brow. I asked if the poison fangs of the cobras had
been extracted, and he brought the largest one for me to
see, holding it just below the head. An obliging Arab provided
a pin, and with this he prized open the jaws. I saw
the tooth but I think the top of it had been broken off.</p>

<p>All this time the drone of the native music went on
interminably. There is something curiously compelling
about its minor key with the little quirks and quavers.
It seems to get on the nerves and to hammer and hammer
on them insistently. It fits well with the blazing sun and
the intensity of the sky. I heard afterwards that the
charmer was a Bedouin, but had been brought up in
Kairouan from childhood. I wanted to paint him and
the musicians, and the sitting was arranged one
afternoon.</p>

<p>Hassan was always full of zeal and spurred me to great
deeds.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>“Mais oui, you must paint them in an open space outside
the town, and then behind them you can paint in the whole
of Kairouan and the desert beyond. It will be a magnificent
picture.”</p>

<p>I bowed my head, and only hoped he would forget to
look for the accessory town and landscape when the sketch
was finished. The men grouped themselves very naturally,
and even the cobras when the time came seemed to have
an instinct for posing. The oldest musician had lost a
finger of his right hand through the bite of one of the stock-in-trade.
They took a deep interest in the sketch, and the
usual small boy that springs out of the dust whenever one
stops for a moment, obligingly kept them posted as to its
progress. I worked for two hours and then shut up my
paint box. Hassan, who had been smoking cigarettes in
the background on a chair brought of course by a relation,
seemed hurt at my want of enthusiasm when he suggested
I should now go and paint a mosque. I had worked all
morning as well, and it was now four o’clock, but he
evidently thought me a poor thing.</p>

<p>The wide stretches of country beyond the walls were
sandy and bare, with only a sparse growth of a heather-like
plant on which the camels fed. There were herds of a
hundred or more, brown or fawn-coloured or sometimes
white. They are the Arabian species having but the one
hump, over which is fastened a large mat that fits down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
over it and looks like a hat, I suppose serving as a protection.
The herds are taken out to graze during the day
and brought back at night. These are the beasts that
belong to town owners and that are hired out for caravans.
The foals run by their mothers’ sides, as furry and long-legged
as young donkeys. A good deal of trade is carried
on with the Bedouins, who bring grain and wool, honey,
eggs and butter into the town, and go out again laden with
sugar, salt and other goods.</p>

<p>There was a fondouk close by the hotel, and from my
window I could hear the roaring of reluctant camels being
loaded in the early morning and the cries of their drivers.
Looking out I could see them standing in the road, one knee
bent, and fastened up by a rope by way of hobbling them.
They are wonderful animals, for at a pinch they will eat
anything from thorns to cactus leaves, and in times of
scarcity they are even fed on date stones. I saw heaps of
these being sold in small market-places for this purpose.</p>

<p>But though he does not disdain such accessory diet, the
camel requires a large quantity of food, and possesses the
useful gift of being able to store up any superfluity of
nourishment in his hump, on which to live in hard times.
The popular fallacy that he can go for days without food
is erroneous, but he lays no stress on the punctuality of his
meals as a horse does, and this is a valuable trait in a beast
that is used for long journeys across the desert where fodder<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
is scarce. His strange figure with its thin, fragile-looking
legs that fold up like a pocket ruler when he lies down, and
the small cynical head set on the long swaying neck, suits
the sandy wastes and the exotic charm of the East. He
walks with slippered tread, wrapt in aloofness. One is
baffled by his haughty indifference. He groans and protests
as his load is being fastened on, but only as a matter of
form, for his docility is remarkable. Overload him, or
force him to journey when he is ill, still his protests are no
louder. He just dies. Quite quietly and without warning,
he lies down and refuses to live, baffling, in death as in life,
the comprehension of the bewildered European.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II<br />
<span class="smaller">SECTS AND SUPERSTITIONS</span></h2>

<p>Mohammedanism is the national religion of Tunisia, but
it is not always realised that there are many sects, each
basing its belief on the teaching of different religious
leaders during the first centuries after the death of the
Prophet. The divergences arose in the first instance from
varying interpretations of the words of the Koran, and
doubtless these divergences have crystallised since into
very marked tenets. There are, I believe, more than
eighty religious “orders” in the Moslem world, but the
word does not bear the same signification as it does in
European countries. The follower of an order belongs to
an association which does not interfere with his
family life or with his profession. At the head of each
denomination is a “sheik” who takes up his dwelling, as
a rule, near the tomb of its founder.</p>

<p>The sect of the Aïssaouia is remarkable for its extraordinary
religious dances. It was founded by Si Mohamed
ben Aïssa who died in 1524 at Meknès. Its disciples claim a
complete immunity from the effect of poison. According
to the legend, its founder was exiled by the Sultan of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
Morocco on account of his popularity with the people.
Crossing the desert his followers suffered greatly from
hunger, whereupon their leader told them they might
safely eat scorpions, snakes, stones and thorns. This the
votaries of his religion still do during their celebrations,
endeavouring to prove that the faithful can at will
suspend his bodily sensations through fasting and prayer.</p>

<p>Their services are usually held once a week, and I went
to one at Kairouan in the Mosque of the Three Doors. It
began at 5 p.m. The worshippers squatted in two rows
on a square of matting facing each other and reciting
prayers. One man after another called out the phrase in
a high nasal voice, and the rest made a response in chorus.
They kept swaying backwards and forwards and getting
more excited. Sometimes the recitation was followed
by a low abrupt sound from the rest, that sounded like the
growl of a tiger. Meanwhile a boy handed round a cup
of water at intervals to the worshippers, and afterwards
brought in a brazier of hot coals at which he busied himself
warming the parchment of the native drums.</p>

<p>It was fast getting dusk. In a corner sat a group of
European spectators, and behind them was a pierced door
through which came the fanatical <i>ull-ul-la</i> of women
devotees. It was a weird scene. The floor of the mosque
was paved with narrow bricks set edgeways, with here and
there a slab of mosaic. Stone pillars lost themselves in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
the gloom of the roof, from which hung common kerosene
lamps, strings of ostrich eggs and the coloured glass balls
beloved of natives. Shadows gathered in the dim corners,
and through the open doorway one could catch a glimpse
of the evening sky; whilst interminably the rows of squatting
figures swayed backwards and forwards and the chant
grew more and more insistent. After what seemed hours,
they rose to their feet, and the thudding of tom-toms began.
The worshippers ranged themselves standing in a row, and
a wretched unhealthy looking creature in a ragged brown
burnous was brought forward. Louder and louder came
the throb of the music, faster and faster the figures intoned
and swayed. It seemed a whirlpool of sound, with that
sinister group of devotees at the centre of it.</p>

<p>There was a sudden piercing wail from the women behind
the door which seemed to cleave through the clotted sound
of the drums and chant like the flash of a poignard. The
grey light from the door fell on the ghastly face of the
ragged youth. Twitches ran over his body and he
staggered out from the rest. His head was thrust forward,
and he held his arms stiffly behind him, jerking himself
convulsively to the rhythm of the chants. He seemed to
be half-hypnotised. His sickly face shone livid in the dim
light, his eye-balls were turned up, and he moved in a
series of jerks, staggering from side to side. And still the
chanting and the music went on, barbaric and horrible, till<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
the tension of one’s nerves became almost unbearable.
The chief priest shouted something in a strident voice, and
seizing the wretched creature by the shoulder he guided
him round the mosque holding an object that dangled
between the fingers of the other hand. As the group
neared us, I saw it was a live scorpion about two inches
long.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the boy was staggering and nearly falling
and seemed to have little or no power over his limbs. It
was horrible to watch, but I could not turn my eyes away.
Suddenly the priest pressed the victim’s head back and
dropped the wriggling insect into his open mouth. As far
as I could see, the wretched creature devoured it ecstatically;
I marked the movements of his throat as he swallowed.
This was repeated twice. After that he was given large
pieces of jagged glass, and these too he seemed to swallow.
I cannot describe how horrible the whole thing was: the
gloomy interior, the fanatical howling of the worshippers,
and the dazed half-mad youth in the midst. He had been
clinging to his guide, staggering from side to side. Suddenly
he fell unconscious on the ground, and lay there groaning.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the ceremony went on, paying no more
attention to him. Now first one and then another of the
worshippers began to jerk backwards and forwards and to
pull off their outer garments. One kept flinging his head
from side to side, whilst his long black hair flapped first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
this way and then that. Long metal spikes about four
feet in length were brought and the fanatics drove them into
their throats or seemed to do so. In any case they drove
them in so far that they held without support. They were
led round, the ‘swords’ sticking out of their bare necks like
pins in a pincushion. I felt quite sick, but worse was yet
to come when they knelt down and the priest drove the
flat-headed spikes still further in with a hammer. No
blood flowed. All this time the drums and the chanting
went on, till one’s brain reeled.</p>

<p>I think the men were in a state of hypnotic trance—their
eyes were half-closed and they jerked backwards and
forwards grunting at every stroke of the hammer. It was
so horrible that I could not look at it for more than a few
seconds. It was not only the dance itself but the whole
feeling of barbarism and degradation. The atmosphere
itself felt evil.</p>

<p>The doors were wide open and a few native children stood
there staring at the scene within. One after another the
row of worshippers began to jerk and step forward, already
one burly man had fallen forward on his face and lay inert,
the scorpion-eater was a mere twitching mass in a corner,
and I had had enough and was thankful to push my way
into the open air.</p>

<p>I stepped out into the courtyard of the mosque. Already
the sky had paled to a clear amber, barred with the few<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
flaming clouds of sunset. At the fondouk near by, camels
were being loaded up to leave the town. They padded
silently past in the dusk, their nodding heads turned to the
tawny plain that stretched away in the distance to the
soft purple of distant hills. Far away, twinkling lights
showed the Bedouin encampments for which they were
bound. One by one the great creatures passed me, the
dust like smoke about their feet, followed by silent hooded
figures along the white streak of road that led into the
golden haze where the sun went down. Slowly the procession
melted away into the distance till it merged into
the blue haze that hung about the plain, leaving but a
little feather of ruffled sand to show which way it had gone.</p>

<p>Though the educated classes, at least the men, are probably
not much influenced by superstitions, the lower
classes, especially the women, are cumbered about with them
from the day of their birth to that of their death. The
Koran allows the existence of certain supernatural beings,
midway between angels and men, called genii, and these
consist of two kinds, peris and djinns: the former are
friendly, but the djinn if not actually malevolent is full
of mischief, and it is as well to placate him. Different
varieties live in fire, air and water. When drawing water
from a well, the prudent housewife does not let down the
bucket too suddenly, lest she might disturb a sleeping
water-djinn. Any sudden movement might hurt or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
affront these invisible beings. Besides the constant anxiety
to keep on the right side of them, there are a hundred and
one things which are unlucky and must be avoided. Should
you go to see an invalid on Friday, that person will die.
Indeed, on any day of the week it is wiser not to call on
him in the afternoon.</p>

<p>The black hand (erroneously called the hand of Fatma,
Mohammed’s favourite daughter) painted on the walls
of houses and on the prows of fishing boats is designed to
avert the evil eye, and a tiny hand is often tattooed on the
cheek or worn in the form of a brooch fastened in the folds
of the turban. A piece of paper with a verse or two of
the Koran written on it is put above the door to warn off
scorpions, and many carry round their necks or in their
turbans small amulets containing verses of the holy
writings. These are also often hung round the necks of
horses and camels. The burning of hyssop in the rooms
of a house keeps evil spirits at bay, and seems a pleasantly
easy method of disconcerting them.</p>

<p>Naturally enough in this atmosphere of superstition,
the services of sorcerers and ‘wise women’ are much sought
after, for the providing of talismans or for more nefarious
designs. Nearly all are of Moroccan extraction, it being
well known that those of that country are particularly
powerful. The following legend explains how this came
about.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>One day Allah sent forth some angels on a special mission
to the earth. But beguiled by the charms of earthly women,
the spirits lingered so long over their task and performed
it so badly that they incurred the wrath of the Most High.
Fearing lest their conversation on their return might trouble
the limpid peace of heaven or sow discontent in young
seraph hearts, Allah condemned the culprits to be cast
forth for several centuries to a region midway between
heaven and the earth. There, suspended in the æther
above Fez, the exiled angels busy themselves in making
amulets which they throw upon the earth below, to the
great aggrandisement of the sorcerers of Morocco.</p>

<p>When it is feared that someone has been ‘overlooked’
by the evil eye, a magician is hastily sent for, and verses
of the Koran are usually administered either externally
in the shape of an amulet applied to the afflicted part, or
internally, chopped up in hot water. Should the patient
show no immediate signs of relief, the prescription is repeated
till he either dies or recovers. A good deal is also
done by the muttering of incantations and the touching
of the sufferer. These ‘wise people’ are also extremely
useful should a person wish to do harm to an enemy. By
the saying of certain incantations accompanied by the
shutting of a knife, his life may be quietly cut off with no
unpleasant fuss whatever. Or magic powders can be
introduced into the water he drinks or the food he eats,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
which will ensure the destruction of the peace of his household
or serious illness to himself. This latter seems the
more likely result of the two.</p>

</div>

<p>They are also much sought after for love-philtres, or
methods of reviving a waning love. There is a horrible
story of a woman of good birth in Tunis many years ago,
who consulted a magician as to the best way to regain her
husband’s love. She was told she must give him <i>couscous</i>
to eat, “made by a dead hand.” By dint of bribes, she
made her way to a cemetery at midnight, had the newly
buried body of a woman disinterred, set the corpse against
a gravestone, and holding its rigid hand in hers used it to
stir the contents of the cooking pot she had brought. The
dead woman was then returned to the peace of her grave,
and next day the unconscious husband ate the couscous.
But alas! we do not know with what results. The facts
leaked out and there was a great scandal over the desecration
of a grave, but owing to the social position of the
culprit the matter was hushed up.</p>

<p>I was told a strange story too by a European resident
in Tunis. Some young man of Arab extraction became
engaged, but wearying of his fiancée and wishing to marry
someone else he consulted a native sorcerer. By degrees
the girl became ill and seemed to be wasting away
mysteriously. Doctors could do nothing and the mother
was overcome with grief, as also appeared to be the young<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
man. At last an old negress servant declared to the
parents that their daughter must have been bewitched.
Distracted at the girl’s rapid decline, they finally let the
negress take them to consult a famous Arab sorcerer, in
fact the very man to whom the young man had applied.
Yes, he said, she would die, but he could save her were
they prepared to give a higher sum than the young man
had paid him to have the curse laid upon her. To this
they agreed. A black cock was brought, its heart was
taken out and transfixed with a nail on which was skewered
her name, and it was then roasted at a slow fire.
“And for a further larger sum,” remarked the magician,
“I will transfer the malady to the young man himself.”
But the parents fled. The patient recovered, and the
engagement was speedily broken off.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III<br />
<span class="smaller">AN ARAB WEDDING</span></h2>

<p>Within a mile or two of Kairouan were various small
orchards and gardens, and Ali Hassan told me importantly
that he was the owner of one of these, consisting of olive
trees, fruit trees and vines, for which he had given 600
francs, and that with taxes and extra payments the whole
had cost him no less than a thousand. I was suitably
impressed. But during a drive in that direction some of
his pride collapsed. He had shown me his property with
its mud hut in one corner which he referred to magnificently
as “ma maison.” He intended to have it moved down to
the roadside end of the field, “for a highway brings much
money.” There he will have a little shop and sell coffee
and beans, grapes and fruit.</p>

<p>The garden itself looked like a child’s game in the road,
just bare twigs sticking up in small heaps of dust; but that
was December and Hassan saw it in his mind’s eye by
March, pink with almond blossom and starred with the
bloom of apricots. Further along the road a gloom fell
upon him, and at last he turned from the box seat beside
the driver.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<p>“Do you see that truly magnificent garden on the other
side, and the beautiful house with three rooms? That was
once mine.”</p>

<p>There was a dramatic pause. I enquired delicately how
he had been forced to part with it.</p>

<p>“Because the owner of it died, and it was sold for more
francs than would stretch from here to the city.”</p>

<p>It was indeed a beautiful property. Many olives and
apricot trees were in it and there was a good well, and at
his house he had a little business where he sold cakes and
coffee and such like. And as many travellers and Bedouins
pass up and down the way to Kairouan, he had made money.
“Mais oui, it is the road that brings money,” and he sank
into a brooding silence.</p>

<p>However, he recovered his cheerfulness when he took
me to see his town house. He was anxious I should make
a picture of his wife and family, but when we arrived it was
to find the former had gone to the baths, taking the smaller
children with her. I had seen her before, but now I was
introduced to the eldest daughter, a pretty girl of thirteen
whom we found at her loom weaving carpets. Her father
explained she was busy making money towards her wedding,
which would probably take place in a year or two. He
would select the bridegroom, and she would not even have
seen him beforehand. The little bride-to-be smiled up
shyly at me. Her hair was curling and very black, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
her complexion olive. Beautiful dark eyes, fringed with
long lashes and underlined with kohl gave character to
her face, with its straight nose inclined to the aquiline and
the full well-drawn mouth. She gave promise of unusual
beauty, and already looked three or four years older than
she was, to my English eyes. She made a charming picture
dressed in a dark short sleeved bodice over a pink cotton
under-shift, full cotton pantaloons drawn in at the ankle,
and her slim brown feet tucked under her. A faded red
handkerchief was tied over her hair, and her bare slender
arms moved backwards and forwards as she bent forward
deftly knotting in the pieces of wool on the fabric. She
worked with the swiftness of long practice, her pretty henna-stained
fingers picking out the colours required from a pile
of coloured wools in front of her. The little room she sat
in was quite bare except for the loom and the matting spread
on the beaten earth floor.</p>

<p>On coming in from the door in a quiet street, we had
bent down to get through the opening into the room on the
left. The walls were whitewashed, roughly decorated
with crude coloured drawings of the lucky hand of Fatma.
Through this living-room one stepped into a small courtyard,
with a collection of green plants in pots in one corner,
and a clothes line stretched across it on which flapped a
few coloured garments. Two more rooms and a tiny
cooking-place opened off it. I was shown the bedroom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
with great pride. There were rugs on the floor, and two
large beds built into recesses. Coloured illustrations from
European magazines adorned the walls, and a very well
drawn portrait of Hassan’s father done by some French
artist to whom he had acted as guide. There was a portrait
of a very wooden and staring-eyed Bey and another of his
predecessor. Hassan stood in the room watching my face
for an expression of surprise and delight which I managed
to produce. To my remarks he waved his hand round his
possessions. “It is nothing,” he said, “you should have
seen my country house.”</p>

<p>There was another woman in the living room, Hassan’s
sister, who with her husband occupied the other bedroom,
a discontented-looking handsome girl, about twenty-two,
more gaudily dressed than the little carpet-weaver. She
squatted on the floor cracking almonds with her white
teeth and putting the kernels into a small earthenware
bowl. A smouldering good-looking piece, thoroughly bored
with life and probably meditating a speedy change of husbands.</p>

<p>I met some English missionaries who had been in the
country for thirty years, and they told me that divorce is
very common amongst the inhabitants. It is even rather
the rule than the exception, and it is almost as often
resorted to on the part of the wife as on that of the husband.
It can be procured for the most trifling causes, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
divorcée does not lose social caste. She returns to her
father’s house and usually remarries, though in that case
the father cannot command as good a payment for her as
he received from her first husband. Should there be
children the question of their maintenance is settled by
the Kaïd. The missionaries naturally were brought more
in contact with the lower classes, amongst whom they
thought divorce was commoner than in the wealthier
circles. The poorer women go out closely veiled, but those
of better birth live almost entirely in their houses and on
the very rare occasions when they do go out, it is in a closed
carriage with all the blinds down. However, they rarely
resent their seclusion in the harem; they look on it as an
enhancement of their value, and these missionaries had
never heard any complaint of the system.</p>

<p>It is quite likely that whilst we are pitying the women
of the harem for their secluded, miserable lives, they are
also wasting compassion on us, as poor creatures whom
their husbands value so little that they let them wander
anywhere unveiled! But I think compassion is hardly
the sentiment with which we inspire them. Horror and
disgust are their more probable feelings. At every turn
we run counter to their idea of what is seemly and in good
taste; and this question alone, of the different conception
of women’s standing in the East and in the West, makes
mutual understanding difficult between the two races.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p>Though the Koran allows four wives, it is not often a
man avails himself of the permission. It is too expensive,
and he prefers to take his supply consecutively. He can
get as much change as he likes, by the easy way of divorce.
I went to an Arab wedding of the poorer classes at Kairouan,
and found it deeply interesting. It was a cold clear night
with a bright moon, the open space outside the walls of the
city silvered in its light. It seemed strangely quiet and
empty after the stir and bustle of the day; the little booths
were shut, and a slinking white dog nosed amongst the
shadows. From a distant café came the sound of a stringed
instrument and the singing of a reedy voice. Otherwise
silence. But when we had passed through the city gates,
we heard a loud hum of voices. Muffled figures were
hurrying along and soon we found ourselves in a crowd
waiting for the marriage procession. Knots of musicians
appeared and struck up their queer wavering tunes on pipes
and drums and barbaric looking stringed instruments,
whilst some hand held aloft a lamp which made a small
radius of ruddy flame, lighting up the group below it and
making the hooded figures look more mysterious than ever.
From a side street came the shrill call of women shouting
to keep evil spirits from the dwelling of the newly married
pair, whilst nearer and nearer came the sound of the
approaching procession.</p>

<p>In a few moments it moved past, the bridegroom in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
middle of it, his head and shoulders shrouded in a thick
covering. The noise woke a bundle of inanimate rags
against the wall at our feet; it stirred, groaned and sat up.
To the sound of shouting and drums and the intoning of a
nasal chant, the bridegroom disappeared down the echoing
street on his way to the mosque. Already the bride had
been fetched to his home, the civil service having taken
place the day before. We made a short cut there, between
blank walls where the path seemed a trickle of light through
impenetrable shadows.</p>

<p>And so we came to the house itself. Mysterious veiled
figures stood motionless on the roof, like sentinels of Fate.
In the gloom my hand was seized by a native woman’s,
small and dry, and I was led into the house followed by my
English companion. We were taken across one room, and
brought to the doorway of another from whence came a
hum of voices and laughter. Peering into this smaller
room we saw it packed with gaily-dressed women squatting
on the ground, whilst in the corner sat the bride like a
waxen image. She was swathed in a robe of heavily
tinselled stuff and over her head was thrown a drapery that
quite hid her face. Not a soul spoke French, but we were
hospitably beckoned in. It proved a matter of some
difficulty to avoid stepping on the human mosaic which
covered the floor but we managed it somehow and sat
down in very cramped positions in places of honour close<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
to the bride. She sat with her back against the bed, which
in Arab fashion was in an alcove. So great was the throng,
that our advent had pressed a small child under the bed
itself, from whence first came a doleful snuffling, followed
at last by a determined wail. It was as much a work of
art to rescue the victim as to extract a winkle from its
shell with a pin, but it was ultimately restored to the bosom
of its family.</p>

<p>All this time the bride sat rigid and unbending as befits
a modest Arab maiden. She made no sign of life, even
when the woman next her raised the heavy veil for us to
see her. She was a rather heavy-featured girl, her face
artificially whitened, with a brilliant dab of rouge on either
cheek, her forehead painted with an ornamental design
in black and her eyebrows made to meet in a straight line.
Her fingers had been dipped in some dark scented ointment,
whilst the backs were decorated in an intricate pattern
with henna and the palms dabbed here and there. Her
hair was in two heavy plaits on either shoulder and she
wore a coloured silk handkerchief bound over it and above
that a tinselled head-dress with a long tail to it that hung
down her back.</p>

<p>The heat in the small room was stifling. The women were
all unveiled and many of them were heavily powdered and
rouged, their fingers loaded with rings and wearing necklaces
and earrings. Some were dressed in queer décolleté<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
dresses reminding one of fashions of twenty years ago,
with tight pointed bodices, much be-sequined and trimmed
and with a kind of gilt epaulettes on the shoulders. Everyone
chattered hard, small babies cried, outside the shouting
and noise of drums went on, and the atmosphere grew
thicker and thicker with the odour of packed humanity,
scent and powder, and the sweet musty smell of garments
that had been laid away in aromatic herbs. Most of the
women were of a warm olive colouring, with beautiful long
dark eyes, and one or two were as fair as English brunettes
with a natural carnation in their cheeks.</p>

<p>Amongst them I made out the mother of the bride,
dressed in shabby black. She had a fine worn face, with
features that showed more mind than the rest of the crowd,
and dark eyes tear-stained in their hollowed sockets. The
cheekbones were high, the nose short and straight, and the
sad mouth drooped at the corners. It was the face of a
woman who could think and suffer, and stood out amongst
the comely crowd in the same way that her black draperies
‘told’ against their gay clothes. She reminded me of the
Virgin in the Pietà of Francia in the National Gallery.
At times she wept softly with eyes that seemed already
burnt out with sorrow, drying her tears with a fold of her
veil. I longed to know Arabic, that I might speak to her.
Amongst foreigners whose language one does not know
and having no mutual tongue for comprehension, one is as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
deaf and dumb, all power of observation and understanding
centred in sight. So, I suppose, must a deaf mute pass
through the world, striving to participate in the brotherhood
of humanity, watching for a gleam here, a glance there,
to unlock the perpetual riddle.</p>

<p>At last the bridegroom was approaching.</p>

<p>The women began to leave for the larger room where we
thankfully followed. But there we were not much better
off, as in a moment a feminine crowd closed in upon us in
a frenzy of friendly curiosity. It was like stepping into
a cageful of monkeys. They seized our arms, ran their
hands over us, exclaiming and gesticulating, fingered our
blouses, our ornaments, and trying to pull off our hats.
It was only the arrival of the bridegroom that averted their
attention. He was brought by another way into the
room, still veiled, and then the bride was brought to him
and amidst much laughter and shouting his head covering
was removed. After this they were conducted to the door
of another bedroom, stepping over the sill of which each
tried to step on the other’s foot, the one who succeeds being
supposed to have the predominance in their future married
life. The door was shut on them, “et voilà tout” as a
small Arab boy remarked to me, glad to air his slender
French.</p>

<p>I was told later that when the bridegroom finds himself
alone with his bride he lifts her veil and sees her face for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
the first time. He takes off her slippers and outer coat
and then leaves her, and rejoins his men friends outside.
If he has not been satisfied with his bride’s appearance it is
still open to him to repudiate her, in which case she will
return to her father’s house. Should he be pleased with
her, however, the next day is given up to a banquet to all
their friends, and he returns to his house where the married
life of the young couple begins.</p>

<p>As soon as the bridal pair had disappeared the crowd
turned its friendly attention to us, and I thought we should
never fight our way through the mob of women. I caught
a glimpse of the young Englishwoman in a perfect maelstrom
of females, her hat off, her blouse almost torn from
her shoulders. I waded to her with difficulty as one might
through heavy surf, and laughing and breathless we at last
got clear and out into the open air. The Englishmen and
Hassan had had to stay outside, only women being allowed
in. “And was the bride very beautiful?” Hassan asked
with romantic interest. He told us the feast that would
take place next day would be a great one: half a sheep
roasted, cakes and sweetmeats of every kind.</p>

<p>“Indeed marriage is always a very expensive affair,”
he sighed. “A man is lucky if he is not 500 francs the
poorer by the time it is all over. For his bride he must
give 300 to 400 francs, perhaps even more. Then he must
provide the furniture for the house, and the bed, and one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
set of silk garments for the bride. And also there is the
wedding banquet and for that too he must pay.”</p>

<p>I asked what the bride’s contribution to the household
was; she must bring the mattress and the bedding, also
the cooking pots, and her own clothes.</p>

<p>“Yes, it is not many who can afford to have more than
one wife,” he went on. “And if a man be wishful to have
two, never do they get on together, and thereupon he must
perhaps have two houses or be for ever deafened with their
quarrels.”</p>

<p>He fell into a reverie, whilst we made our way through
the outskirts of the town, past the deserted market-place
that slept in the moonlight, under the shadowy pepper trees
that made a grateful shade in the heat of the day for the
vendors of oranges and sweetmeats, and so through the
city gate back to the quiet little square and the open door
of the hotel.</p>

<p>The scene in the Kairouan Souks was one of great animation
in the afternoon, when auctions were held by the shopkeepers.
The buildings consisted of long narrow passage-ways
whose arched roofs were pierced here and there with
openings to let in light. The shops were on a raised level
on either side as in all Eastern bazaars, and were just
recesses Where the seller squatted amongst his wares,
whilst the customers and spectators sat along the broad
stone edge covered with matting that ran along the front<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
of the booths, their discarded red and yellow slippers
neatly ranged on the ground below.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 350px;">
<img src="images/illus4.jpg" width="350" height="600" alt="" />
<p class="caption">I. M. D.</p>
</div>

<p>Business is conducted slowly and with dignity in the East,
there is much talk and bargaining, coffee is brought and
sipped during the process and then finally, perhaps, a
purchase is made. The shopman in his flowing soft-coloured
robes, probably wearing a flower over one ear,
slowly measures the desired carpet or rug by hand, from
the elbow to the tips of his fingers. There is more discussion,
and at last the purchaser brings out a worked
leather purse and counts out the requisite payment.</p>

<p>But during an auction, the scene was much more animated.
Shop assistants rushed up and down carrying goods and
bawling at the top of their voices “What offers? what
offers?” Customers bid against each other and the noise
and bustle were tremendous. Every other moment a panting
native rushed back to the owner of the shop to ask if
the latest offer were to be accepted. Up the side-passages
opening into the central Souk, more auctions might be
going on simultaneously, and the crowd was so great that
sketching had to be of the snapshot variety.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/illus5.jpg" width="300" height="400" alt="" />
<p class="caption">I. M. D.</p>
</div>

<p>Nearly all the men were in white or sand-coloured
burnous, with the hood partly pushed back, showing the
small twisted turban and close red fez worn underneath.
The Tunisian countrymen are in general fine looking men,
tall and aquiline featured, with good foreheads and clearly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
marked eyebrows. Nearly all have a moustache and a
dark closely clipped beard, but one sees a few of fairer type
amongst them. They are friendly and courteous. A
gamin told one grave and dignified looking figure that I
was sketching him, whereupon my model glanced at me,
smiled and shrugged his shoulders. I showed him the
sketch and he laughed, much amused. Very often the
shopkeepers near whom I was sitting with my sketch-book
offered me coffee and I always met with hospitality and
goodwill. If one asks their permission before settling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
down, it is always granted, and they usually take one more
or less under their protection, and try to prevent a crowd
from collecting.</p>

<p>I like the Arabs’ fine dignity. Probably their flowing
style of dress helps to give this effect, and the hooded
cloak makes a becoming setting to their dark faces. Even
the tiny boys wear the burnous and go about looking like
small elves in their pointed hoods.</p>

<p>Outside the western walls of the city, the graveyards
stretched right away as far as the Mosque du Barbier,
which lay about half a mile from the town. The tombs
were not marked by any inscriptions, and often were only
covered by a small rounded slab or just roughly enclosed
by an edging of bricks. On these poorer graves a cluster of
bricks set sideways in the earth told the sex of the dead:
if set close together they mark the resting place of a man,
if scattered, that of a woman. There is something inexpressibly
forlorn about these Moslem cemeteries, the graves
so huddled together, no green, no flowers. The tiny
spectacled owl perches on the low headstones or makes his
silent flight from one to the other, and beyond the graveyard
itself the whole sky flames to brilliant red at the going
down of the sun.</p>

<p>The sunsets in Kairouan were magnificent. The whole
of the west seemed to burst into fire and the desert glowed
with a deep reflected rose. I call it ‘desert’ but it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
not really this. ‘Le vrai desert’ is far off. But the
wide stretches of sandy waste looked the name, and at
sunset they turned a wonderful red, with washes of dusty
purple, whilst the far hills were first violet and then almost
black against the last splendour of the sky.</p>

<p>Coming home through the cemetery one evening, Ali
Hassan was anxious to know if I had read the Koran, and
begged me to carry one about with me; “it would protect
you greatly.” I asked him if the Fast of Ramadan was
kept very strictly in Kairouan. He said yes, “except
that there are always some who do not follow their religion
seriously. They do not pray regularly, neither do they
fast carefully for a month at Ramadan. But they will
find the difference when they reach the other world. For
every Ramadan they have broken here, they will have to
fast a year hereafter. <em lang="fr">Ils auront joliment faim</em>,” he ended
with satisfaction. I gather he himself is a scrupulous
observer of his religion.</p>

<p>When I left Kairouan, Hassan came to see me off, wishing
me happiness and prosperity, and hoping I should return
some day. He presented me with one of his most treasured
possessions, a picture postcard of himself and his family
at the Marseilles Exhibition. There they all were posing
under a tent, and labelled ‘Fabrication de Tapis de
Kairouan (Tunisie) Maison Ali Hassan.’ Even under these
trying conditions I was glad to see Hassan had still<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
continued to look dignified. There was his wife to the left
of the picture wearing all the family jewels and watching a
sleeping baby that even in slumber seemed to remember
it was ‘en exposition.’ The little girls were working at
their handloom, whilst Hassan himself sat with a son on
either side, and a row of family slippers in varying sizes
ranged along the edge of the mat in front of him. He was
immensely proud of this work of art.</p>

<p>As my train steamed slowly away from Kairouan, I saw
him still on the platform, his portly figure wrapped in the
voluminous folds of a white burnous, watching till the
distance had swallowed me up.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV<br />
<span class="smaller">SOUSSE</span></h2>

<p>The country through which the train passed from Kairouan
to Sousse was bare and desolate, with scarce scattered
Bedouins’ tents now and again that seemed to blend with
their surroundings like the nests of wild birds. A few
grazing camels wandered near them, herded by ragged
children who turned to stare at the train. The plains
stretched as far as the eye could reach to the feet of distant
hills. We passed one or two shallow lakes, obviously
rainfall collected in depressions of the ground, that would
dry up as some we had already seen which were now nothing
but stretches of cracked and seamed mud, looking like
jigsaw puzzles.</p>

<p>Sousse proved to be a picturesque little town on the sea,
built about the base of the old Kasba or fort, whose walls
stand on a hill above it, looking out over the flat-roofed
white houses of the modern town to the waters of the
Mediterranean. From the fort itself there was a magnificent
view: on one side the curving coastline with its dotted
white villages and the gentian sea fading to a pale mist in
the distance, on the other, vistas of olive groves and orchards.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p>The great local industry is the cultivation of olives, and
there are factories for the making of oil and soap on the
outskirts of the town. The actual care of the trees is
almost entirely in the hands of the Arabs, to whom the
French owner usually sells the crop in bulk, unpicked.
A tree in full bearing is worth three to four hundred francs
a year, and an orchard may contain thousands of trees. The
Arabs are so improvident that they often spend all the
money they make during the harvest, in six months’ time,
and then are forced to realise in advance on their next.
Frequently they get into the hands of the Jews in
transactions in which it is certainly not the latter who
suffer.</p>

<p>Beyond the Kasba are the Christian catacombs, which
are interesting, and cover a large area. Passage after
passage is tunnelled out, with poor little skeletons neatly
stowed away on either side as a careful housewife stocks
her store cupboard with jam.</p>

<p>The Souks are not so picturesque nor as extensive as
those of Kairouan and of Sfax, but the crowd was enthralling
to watch. In the native cafés grave men in picturesque
draperies were seated along the broad stone ledge on either
side the room, sipping coffee or playing a kind of chess,
whilst the owner bent over his charcoal fire at the far end,
and the assistant sped about on bare feet carrying sheaves
of the long-handled coffee holders, just big enough to fill
each minute cup. To this is often added a drop of orange
flower water or some sweet essence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>

<p>In the brilliant sunshine outside the arcade a peasant
squatted on the paved path whittling at flutes made from
a cut piece of cane ornamented with red and green paint.
He played a few sweet husky notes to show his skill.
Opposite to him sat a vendor of oranges, and a seller of the
brown flat loaves of native bread sprinkled on the top with
seeds, and beyond them a man with a tray of sweetmeats,
slabs of toffee, cakes of chopped nuts, brilliantly coloured
strips of pink rock, and sugar birds striped red and green
and set on wire stems to attract children. All these
huddled on the ground, their wares spread round them,
whilst at the end of the steep stony street one saw the
frowning battlements of the Kasba rising sheer against
the sky, and looking downhill caught a glimpse of the blue
of the sea and the white sails of fishing boats like drowning
butterflies in the harbour. Across the bay were the houses
of the little fishing village of Monastir. The country just
round Sousse is all olive groves, with huge hedges of spiked
cactus, and when I was there in January, shrivelled prickly
pears still hung along the edges of the leaves. There had
been so many that year that they had not all been picked.
The whole country teems with Roman remains, and one
sees fragments sticking up out of the ground wherever
foundations are being dug for a house.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p>I went from there to spend the day at El Djem to see the
wonderful ruins of its amphitheatre. To reach it, one again
travels through a great stretch of bare country. The
engine of the train broke down and we were delayed for
about two hours en route. We first ran over an Arab, and
in his efforts to avoid this, the driver had put on his brakes
so suddenly that he injured the mechanism of the engine.
None of the passengers seemed to be much perturbed when
they heard afterwards of the Arab having been killed.
Indeed the man must have been a confirmed suicide, for
the country is so bare that a train can be seen coming two
miles off, and its progress is deliberate enough to give the
most dreamy of pedestrians time to realise his danger.
Perhaps it is like the Trans-Siberian railway, where compensation
used to be given to the family of the deceased,
till it was discovered that the peasants were driving a
lucrative trade in aged relatives.</p>

<p>Before reaching El Djem, I saw the huge ruins of the
amphitheatre against the sky. They looked immense,
with a small Arab village about their feet. In colour they
were a warm brown, built of enormous blocks of stone;
and the size of the building took my breath away. I am
told it is as fine as the Colosseum at Rome, and of course
it gains in grandeur from its isolated position. Forlorn
and ruined as the building is, with its arches like empty
eye-sockets staring into space, there is still something<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
magnificent and defiant about it. Most of the tiers for
spectators are still there, part of the Imperial entrance and
ranges of arched openings. Below, in the centre, are the
prisoners’ cells and the dens for wild beasts, with the
openings by which the latter were released into the arena.</p>

<p>I sat on a large block of stone. Pigeons flew in and out
of the galleries where Roman ladies used to sit and watch
the gladiators and the fights with savage animals below.
Grass grew along the edges of the walls, and a tuft of
wild thyme waved in the breeze. It was a grey day, and
against the sad sky the great edifice seemed to stand
brooding over its past splendour.</p>

<p>I went with the Arab custodian across fields, by narrow
footpaths edged with spiked battledores of prickly pears,
and was shown vestiges of a paved Roman road and the
remains of a villa. We passed an old well, used still by the
villagers, at which a young girl was drawing water. These
village people go unveiled and she stared at us, a slender
brown slip of a child in a ragged blue robe caught across
her smooth shoulder by silver brooch pins. Her face was
pointed, a tiny trident was tattooed on her forehead, and
another mark on her chin. She gazed at me with her
bright dark eyes the underlids of which were darkened
with kohl, and then turned again to the filling of the red
amphora-shaped jar she carried. I watched her walk
away, graceful and erect, bearing the earthenware vessel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
of water on her head, her bare feet moving noiselessly along
the dusty path.</p>

<p>Numberless children ran out to meet us in the village,
laughing merry little things in tattered burnous and blue
gown, incredibly dirty and cheerful, with a constant flash
of white teeth. Even the tiniest girls wore thick metal
anklets, and tots of five or six carried baby brothers astride
their hips. The children’s playtime is a short one; at
seven or eight years old they are already at work herding
cattle or collecting fodder and fetching heavy jars of water
from the wells. I have often seen a small girl almost
weighed down with the weight of a jar of water. They
crouch down whilst an older one lifts it on to their back
and passes a cord round their forehead to hold the jar in
place. Then, staggering, the poor little thing gets to her
feet and starts off, almost bent double. The Arabs are
very fond of their children and good to them, but they
never seem to realise what heavy work they put on them.</p>

<p>Later, from the small station, I watched the day fade and
dusk settling on the countryside. Slow-pacing camels
were making their homeward way driven by young boys,
whilst here and there a little group of workers was returning
from the fields. The sky turned to a clear translucence
in the West, the amphitheatre blurred to a formless mass
of grey girdled about the knees with a blue haze of smoke
from the Arab village. Dogs barked from behind its mud<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
walls, and the pale stars began to peer from between the
clouds. First here, then there, the warm flicker of a fire
showed through an open doorway; and all these homely
signs of village life seemed to make ever more and more
remote the great outline of the ruins. For a time I could
still see the sky through the top arches of the building,
but even that faded by degrees, till at last night folded
her mantle about the vastness of its desolation.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V<br />
<span class="smaller">PASSING THROUGH</span></h2>

<p>The dark trees along the centre of the boulevard looked
almost artificial against the greenish glare of the electric
lights. From every café streamed bands of revellers,
their brilliant costumes adding to the theatrical appearance
of the streets. Dominoes of every colour flitted about;
orange, purple, emerald and lemon yellow. Showers of
confetti made a pink and blue snow upon the ground, and
the moving crowd passed in and out from the dark shadows
below the trees to the clear-cut brilliance of the light.
Rattles and toy trumpets sounded shrill above the under-note
made by the murmur of the populace. From some
building came the noise of dancing and the crash of a band.
Groups of absurdly dressed figures pushed their way through
the restaurants, here a Teddy bear linking arms with a
Red Indian or an English jockey escorting a ballet-dancer.</p>

<p>And up and down the roadway went little knots of the
poorer people in family parties, father and mother in
dominoes from under which appeared cheaply-shod feet,
whilst rather shabby small Pierrots trotted by their side.
The few fiacres could only move at a foot’s pace, the trams<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
had ceased running. Behind the noise of the carnival
and the hum of voices the town itself was strangely hushed
and the tideless sea down by the harbour made no sound.
Through the foliage of the trees gazed the quiet stars.</p>

<p>There was a queer unreality about it all, thought the
Englishman as he sat at a small table on the raised terrace
of a café and looked down on the passers-by. Vaguely it
struck him what a fine design it might make, the dark
heavy mass of greenery carved against the glittering
background of the lamps, and the coloured snake of people
that wound amongst the stems, paused, coiled and uncoiled.
They shared the unreality of the whole thing. He
felt they could not be real, they were just a boxful of dolls
taken out to be played with and to be swept back into
oblivion when one was tired of them.</p>

<p>The air was soft and warm and it was pleasant to sit
there and gaze dreamily at the shifting scene. A few
Arabs passed, looking impassively at it all: and it was
impossible to read the expression on their dark faces. A
group of palms stood black against the star-freckled sky.
The whole picture in its strangeness stirred his imagination.
This was Africa, even though the country of Tunis were
but the fringe of it. No sea stretched between him where
he sat and the hot wide spaces of the Sahara. Were one
to ride and ride into the far distance, at last one would
escape civilisation altogether, would reach to the primitive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
roots of humanity. And it was a mere chance that had
brought him here.</p>

<p>He loved the sea and hated all liners, so was taking a
trip in the Mediterranean on a small steamer. There had
been a slight breakdown of the engines, and the ship had
put into this little port for repairs. The first night he
spent on board watching the twinkle of lights on the shore,
but to-day he had landed and found himself in the midst
of Carnival rejoicings. He was the only Englishman on
board, and it seemed to him that he was the only Englishman
in this town. At any rate he had seen no other. He heard
French, Italian and Arabic spoken round him, but nothing
else. During the afternoon he had wandered about the
native town, and climbing up a steep and narrow street
that seemed just a gash in the white walls, he had come out
on a height near the fort, from whence he looked down on
the harbour spread below, dotted with tiny craft, beyond it
the restless rim of the sea. He did not know the East, and
the picturesqueness of the Arab town delighted him;
the hooded groups that sat about the doorways, the
statuesque folds of their drapery, the clash of women’s
anklets, the glowing sunlight that seemed to pour into
every nook and cranny like some rich golden wine. It was
all new and strange.</p>

<p>And now to-night there was the feeling of being an
onlooker at some fantastic theatre-scene. As he sat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
smoking and watching, a passing Columbine glanced at
him and smiled; the Englishman in the grey tweed suit
looked so alien in this stir and flutter. And he was young
and good looking. Why should he be alone? But her
glance was thrown away upon him. He sat watching
the scene, absorbed.</p>

<p>He had been there, perhaps, an hour, and was about to
pay for his drink and move on, when a child’s voice made
itself heard at his elbow. He turned. By his side stood
a small Arab boy, wrapped in a mud-coloured garment,
and it was his voice that had aroused his attention. He
gave the child a coin, paid his bill and stepped out into
the street. And again he found the boy beside him. He
was talking in a mixture of broken French and Arabic
impossible to follow. What on earth did the child want?
He turned on him impatiently and the small figure
shrank away, but a few minutes later it was back
again, still repeating some unintelligible phrase. Telling
him angrily in French to go away, the traveller pushed
his way into the crowd. Long festoons of coloured paper
had been flung from hand to hand and fragments of them
hung dangling in the branches, stirred now and then by a
passing breath of wind too faint to set the foliage itself in
motion.</p>

<p>It was close on midnight. He wandered down the
central street on his way to the harbour. As he drew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
near, the tang of seaweed and shipping reached him on the
night air; and turning, he looked back at the coloured
necklace of lights that ringed the shore. His steamer was
due to leave early the next day, and this was the last
glimpse he would have of the place. Queer, he thought,
how he had dipped for a moment into its life. Like opening
the pages of a book, reading a few lines, and then being
forced to close it again.</p>

<p>As he stood there, he became aware of a movement in
the shadows and instinctively drew himself together.
The place was lonely, he was a stranger and might be
thought worth robbing. Then his keen eyes made out
the figure of the child who had already followed him. The
boy came up to him, and this time silently held out a scrap
of white paper on which something was written. The
Englishman took it to the light of a lamp and read it with
difficulty. The paper had evidently been torn from a
pocket book, and across it was scrawled in pencil the
words “Please come,” with an almost illegible signature
underneath them. He stared at the writing, puzzled. He
knew no one in the place, and his first idea was that the
paper had been picked up somewhere. But the Arab boy
was pulling his coat gently and pointing to the town. The
man hesitated. Stories of decoyed travellers, of murder
and robbery passed through his mind, and again he
examined the piece of paper.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>

<p>The writing was evidently English and it was an educated
hand, though faltering and uncertain. The signature was
unreadable but he guessed it to be a man’s. He questioned
the messenger but could not understand what he said,
and the boy kept on pointing to the town and tugging
his coat softly. The traveller did not hesitate long. His
curiosity was roused and there was something adventurous
and romantic about the situation that appealed to his
youth. He signified his decision by a nod, and prepared
to follow his guide.</p>

<p>Swiftly and silently the latter sped in front, turning
now and again to make sure he was followed. His bare
feet made no sound and the cloak wrapped round him so
merged into the surroundings that more than once he
seemed to have disappeared altogether. A late moon had
risen and the roadway gleamed in its light. As they
neared the central thoroughfare with its glare and gay
crowds, the boy struck off into a maze of small streets that
led away from it towards the Arab quarter. The sound
of revelry became fainter and as they climbed the narrow
way they left it behind. Black and white in the moonlight
stood the gate of the native town, and they passed
through it.</p>

<p>The narrow dimly lit streets were almost deserted. In
leaving the modern town they seemed to step suddenly
into a different world, a world where men moved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
mysteriously on secret errands. The stranger found himself
trying to hush the frank sound of his own footsteps,
to bring himself into line, as it were, with his surroundings.
A solitary shrouded figure here and there approached on
noiseless feet and passed, absorbed and enigmatic. The
roadway became so narrow that there seemed but a knife-blade
of light between the black shadows of the overhanging
houses which drew together like conspirators. Turning
and twisting through the tortuous streets the figure
ran ahead, and the Englishman still followed, though
inwardly somewhat dismayed at the distance he was
being taken.</p>

<p>At last they stopped. A low entrance stood in a recess
before them, and the boy softly pushed a door open and
went in, leading the other a few steps through darkness
to a second one which opened into a small courtyard.</p>

<p>The moon shone clearly upon it, showing the arcaded
passage that ran round it on which several rooms opened.
From one there came a thread of lamplight. There was a
small stone well in the centre of the court and the moonlight
lit the dim carving on it and on the slender pillars of the
arcade. Evidently the house had once been a building of
some importance, but it was now shabby and dilapidated.
The paving was uneven with gaping cracks, and the pillars
were broken and defaced.</p>

<p>At the sound of their approach the door with the light<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
was held ajar and a woman’s muffled figure appeared. The
small Arab made a gesture to the Englishman to wait and
went into the room closing the door behind him.</p>

<p>A creeper growing in a pot with its leaves trained against
the wall gave out a faint scent. There was the squeak
and scuffle of a bat in the eaves. From far away came the
sounds of merrymakers, so attenuated by distance as to
be little louder than the bat’s squeak. And in the silence
round the listener pressed the sense of people at hand,
of sleepers stirring to far-off sounds. Then the door on
which his eyes were fixed opened slowly and a bar of ruddy
light slid across the cold whiteness of the moonlight. He
was beckoned in.</p>

<p>On entering he found himself in a small and lofty room
with a marble floor on which a few poor rugs were spread.
There seemed to be no windows and a lamp stood on the
ground. The figure of a woman wrapped in a mantle
squatted on the floor, and on a couch in an alcove the
figure of an Arab raised itself with difficulty on one elbow
to look at him.</p>

<p>“What is it? Why have you sent for me?” the
Englishman asked impatiently, feeling there had been
some hoax, if nothing worse.</p>

<p>At his voice the figure smiled. “It’s rough luck on you
bringing you here at this time of night, you must forgive
me.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>

<p>The traveller stood amazed. The other was no Arab,
then! It was an English voice, drawling and weak, but
unmistakably that of a gentleman.</p>

<p>“By Jove! you’re <em>English</em>!” said the bewildered
newcomer, staring at the strange figure on the couch.</p>

<p>It was that of a tall man in native dress, the face yellowed
and lined and so thin that every bone seemed to show. He
was evidently very ill, his deep-set eyes burning with
fever, his movements weak and uncertain. The Eastern
robes hung loosely on his gaunt body and he was half
sitting, half lying on the couch, propped up with pillows.
Close by him the figure of a woman crouched over a bowl
in which she stirred a dark liquid that gave out a pungent
smell.</p>

<p>The invalid spoke in Arabic and she got up with a jingle
of ornaments and left the room by another door, whilst
the boy went back to the courtyard. The visitor watched
her ungainly figure moving away, more and more bewildered.
What on earth was an Englishman doing here, in these
surroundings and with these people?</p>

<p>The other had been regarding him with a faint ironical
smile about his lips.</p>

<p>“Yes,” he said, “it’s hard to understand. But there it
is. It’s too long a story to tell. Anyway here I am. I’ve
lived the life of an Arab for years. What’s the phrase for
it?—‘gone under’—yes, that’s it. I’ve gone under. My<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
name is Dunsford, and there’s something I want you to do
for me.” He paused.</p>

<p>“My name’s Forde,” the traveller answered. “What
is it you want me to do? Why did you send for <em>me</em>?
We have never met before.”</p>

<p>“I know, I know, but I had to get hold of some Englishman—you
as well as another—I can’t live much longer,
and there’s something I want done. I daresay there are
one or two of our countrymen in the place, but I specially
wanted a stranger. I don’t want people here poking into
my affairs.”</p>

<p>“But,” expostulated Forde, “why not see a doctor?
Or have you got one? I could look up someone in the
town: I’m only passing through myself, but I could find
someone.”</p>

<p>“It’s not a doctor I want. I went to see one some time
ago and there’s nothing to be done. I’ve got medicine
and things,” the other added impatiently seeing an interruption
imminent, “I don’t mind the snuffing out for
myself but I’m worried about one of my boys. I
mean for after I’m gone. He’s taken after my side,”
he went on with a crooked smile, “and he’ll never settle
down out here, I want him got out of it.”</p>

<p>Good heavens! Was he going to ask him to take over
the child? The newcomer was appalled. But the invalid
seemed to read his thoughts.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<p>“It’s all right,” he assured him, “it’s not such a big job
I want you to do. I’ve a brother at home, a J.P. and landowner
and all that sort of thing. He’s a hard man, but
he’s just, and he won’t have a down on the little chap because
his father’s been a rotter. He’ll get him to England and
give him his chance. But I don’t want to write to him
even if I could.” He looked down at his wasted hands.
“No, I want you to look him up when I’m safely gone and
to tell him about the boy, and he’ll do the rest.”</p>

<p>“But I’m only here to-night and I’m off again to-morrow,”
broke in the other. “It’s just an accident I’m
in the place at all. The ship put in for repairs, and I shall
never be here again.”</p>

<p>“All the better,” was the answer, “if I had wanted
someone on the spot I’d have got hold of a consul. But
I’ve cut adrift from all my own lot and I don’t want to be
mixed up with them again. That’s why I told Ibrahim
to find a stranger. And I fancy, by the look of you, that
you can keep your mouth shut.” He grinned. “He’s
been out looking for weeks past and it’s just your rotten
luck that he pitched on you. But you’ll do—you’ll do!”</p>

<p>“But how am I to know?” began Forde, and hesitated.</p>

<p>“Know when I’m downed? I’ve thought it out. The
best plan is for you to leave a postcard with me addressed
to yourself, and when the time comes the boy will post
it. No need to write anything on it: <em>you’ll</em> understand.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>

<p>He stopped exhausted, whilst the young man stared at
him. After a minute he went on again.</p>

<p>“I’ve got my brother’s address written out ready. His
on one side, and mine on the other, and I’ll give it to you.
You’ll do it for me?” he added.</p>

<p>Forde nodded.</p>

<p>“I’d like to show you my son,” the invalid said, “if
you wouldn’t mind giving me an arm I think I can manage
it.”</p>

<p>The younger man helped him to his feet and supported
him to the inner room. Here there were two beds. On
one lay two sleeping dark-skinned children, but the father
passed them and drew back the coverlet to show the occupant
of the further bed. Seldom had Forde seen a lovelier
boy. Flushed with sleep, his fair hair touzled and rough,
he lay fast asleep, his open shirt showing the dimpled milk-white
neck. In his hand he clutched some cherished toy.
He lay on his side, his rosy cheek burrowed into the pillow,
little feathers of gold about his damp forehead. He seemed
about seven.</p>

<p>Dunsford stood looking down at him, a look of mingled
pride and pain on his face, and Forde was able to study
him unobserved. It was a curious and interesting face,
the brow well-shaped and the eyes dark blue and with
something wistful about them. The watcher fancied that
the sleeping child, when awake, might show much the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
wide and faintly-puzzled look. The father too must have
been fair, but the hot suns of the East had burnt his skin
to a deep tan. Below the close red fez and small twisted
turban his fair hair seemed going grey. His extreme thinness
made the sharp ridge of his nose stand out like a beak,
and there was a deep groove on either side between the
nostrils and the hollowed cheeks. He had been recently
shaved and only a gleam of grey showed along the narrow
jaw. The mouth was compressed, but it seemed more
from habit than nature. And now that he was off his
guard its natural mobility could be noted. It was a face
that showed intelligence and sensitiveness, allied with self
will and determination, even a touch of fanaticism. The
face of a man who might be fired by an impracticable
idea, and who would break himself to pieces in trying to
drive it through. He seemed a personality driven in upon
himself. His bearing showed distinction as did also his
well-kept hands.</p>

<p>As he watched the boy his face broke up and softened.
Whatever wall he had built up about his inner self his
defences were down before his son. He re-arranged the
sheet, it seemed more with the motive of touching the
child than for any other reason, and his hand lingered by
the pillow. In the silence could be heard the soft breathing
of the sleeper, till it was broken by a rustle of draperies
as the Arab woman rose from the floor where she had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
sitting beyond the bed. At sight of her the man’s face
changed. He dropped the coverlet and made a sign to his
companion to help him back to the other room.</p>

<p>“You can tell my brother the little beggar’s all right,”
he said as he sank back again upon the couch. “Legal
and all that, you know. I married his mother,” with a
jerk of the head towards the inner room, “before a consul
as well as by Mohammedan law. The boy hasn’t been
christened but my brother will enjoy getting all that done.
Tell him I called him Humphrey after our old grandfather.”
He stopped.</p>

<p>Then following his instructions Forde brought him a box
which he unlocked. Inside it were some documents tied
together, and from the bundle he took a slip of paper with
the addresses and gave it to his companion.</p>

<p>“Now there’s only the post card,” he said. “You’ll
find one on that table. Address it to yourself: to your
home address. Then it is sure to find you.”</p>

<p>The other obeyed and the invalid put the post card
carefully away in the box.</p>

<p>“That’s all, my dear fellow, and a thousand thanks.
It’s a weight off my mind and I hope it won’t be a great
nuisance to you.” He was silent for a time, then “Are
you fond of women?” he asked abruptly. “It was over
one that I went to pieces long ago.” Forde thought of
the huddled shapelessness in the next room.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>

<p>“I was an Army man,” began the voice again, but
checked. “Sorry there’s nothing I can offer you, you
don’t take opium?... But I expect you’ll be glad to be off,
and I can tell you I’ll sleep easier to-night. You’ll find
Ibrahim in the courtyard and he’ll show you the way back.”</p>

<p>The men shook hands and again the invalid declared he
wanted nothing. “Only your promise not to say a word
of this to my brother or to anyone till the post card reaches
you,” he said to Forde, as the latter stepped into the open.</p>

<p>The shadow of the wall had crept a little further across
the courtyard, and a few wisps of cloud dimmed the radiance
of the moon. The figure of Ibrahim rose from the shadows
and moved silently before him, retracing the way that
they had come. The glow of illumination had died down,
and only a scattered knot or two of revellers were to be
seen as they crossed the thoroughfare. Night seemed
to have flowed over the town and to have obliterated all
tumult in her quiet tide. Down by the jetty gleamed the
eye of the steamer, where she lay at her moorings, the water
gently lapping her sides. Ibrahim melted away into the
shadows as the young man stood a moment on deck before
going below, watching the pathway of the moon across
the dark water and the silver sleeping town; thinking
too of the mysterious house in the heart of the Arab
quarter, with its strange secret.</p>

<p>When he awoke in the morning he found they were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
already at sea and through the porthole he could see the
curves of the coastline and the white semi-circle of the
town fading to a faint blur. At first he thought constantly
of the happenings of the night, but the interest and excitement
of travel by degrees pushed them from his mind.</p>

<p>And then four months later it was all sharply recalled.</p>

<p>He was at home and they were sitting out under the big
cedar on the lawn when the second post arrived. “Here’s
your lot—catch!” said his brother throwing some letters
across to him.</p>

<p>“Oh! can I have the stamp?” shrieked a small nephew,
as he saw a foreign postmark.</p>

<p>The budget fell just short of Forde and landed face
downwards, the white blank of a postcard staring at him
from the grass.</p>

<p>He gazed at it silently. A passing breeze shook the
roses on the terrace and a few crimson petals loosened
themselves, fluttered a moment and floated soundlessly
to the ground. There seemed to him a pause in the warm
stir of summer and then a voice cried gaily, “Hullo, who’s
your absent-minded friend?”</p>

<span class="smaller">SFAX</span></h2>

<p>Sfax, like Kairouan and Sousse, is a walled town and the
Souks are even more fascinating than those of Kairouan.
The European part of the town is quite separate, and is
picturesquely built in the Moorish style, the wide streets
planted with palms running across to the harbour with
its busy shipping. It is a very flourishing place, the
centre of the olive oil industry and also the port for the
phosphates which are obtained in such quantities near
Metlaoui and other places. These mines seem almost
inexhaustible, and new veins are always being discovered.
One sees truckloads and truckloads of the stuff, looking
like sand, coming along the line. In running the hand
through it, one finds quantities of fishes’ teeth, quite whole
and perfect and so sharp that they can pierce leather. Some
are as large as the teeth of a fox, pointed and white, and
there are some that have two fangs or even three. The
phosphates are one of the richest products of this country.
The ‘ore’ is sometimes shipped direct from Sfax, being
loaded into vessels specially prepared to carry it, or it is
first chemically treated in the neighbourhood and then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
exported as super-phosphate. The mining districts contain
a large population of workers, chiefly immigrants,
with French managers in authority.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 550px;">
<img src="images/illus7.jpg" width="550" height="600" alt="" />
<p class="caption">The Souks.</p>
<p class="caption">I. M. D.</p>
</div>

<p>Outside the northern walls of Sfax was a large space
where fodder was stacked, and charcoal and grain sold,
and where the laden camels came stepping gravely along
the white highway from the country, and here were small
groups of men squatting round cooking pots, or Bedouins
collecting round two negresses who were stirring beans
over a charcoal fire, shredding in red pepper, the firelight
playing on their broad features and flashing teeth.</p>

<p>The drone of native pipes from a ragged booth close
under the walls, led us in that direction and we found two
Soudanese doing a kind of dance, surrounded by a crowd of
Arabs. They were in a medley of garments, one wearing
an old khaki coat over his accordion-pleated shirt. It had
once been white, but was stained and worn to an indeterminate
shade. Dirty turbans were on their heads. One
stood playing on a curious horned bagpipe, whilst the
other revolved slowly round beating a drum, his hideous
ebony face thrown back, his mouth opening and shutting,
showing the pink interior and a thin tongue that quivered
like an animal’s. Those who gave him money placed it in
this horrid slot and he pouched it instantly in his cheek, all
the time twisting and turning in a sort of dance. The last
time I had seen anything of the sort was when I watched<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
the ‘shimmy shake’ danced by Europeans on board a
liner. There it had been an absurd travesty, civilisation
playing at barbarism. Here was the original stuff, primitive
and raw, under the intense blue of an Eastern sky,
the sunlight pouring down on the scene and making great
blocks of shadow under the awning and at the feet of
stacked bales of pale yellow chaff.</p>

<p>The crowd were chiefly in neutral tints, broken with the
bright crimson of a fez here and there, the warm madder
of a cloak dyed in henna, or the brilliant lemon yellow of
native slippers.</p>

<p>Along the road a group of Bedouins passed like a classic
frieze against the white background of a marabou. Four
camels in single file led by a man wrapped in a cloak,
each laden camel topped by a huddled blue figure that bent
and swayed to the motion. Two or three Bedouin women
accompanied them on foot, in loose girdled robes, bearing
burdens on their heads. Barefoot and erect they strode
past, their olive throats covered with necklaces of coins,
their handsome tattooed faces set to the open country.
They are impatient even of the scant civilisation of the
Souks. They are a people of free spaces and the wide
sky; as soon might the kestrel companion with the
dove, as these wild natures fraternise with city folk.
And as they swung past, the frowning crenellated walls
of the city looked down, as they have done for ages past,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
upon them and the
bustle and crowd of
the Souks, gazing
beyond them to the
gentian sea, whose calm
they have watched
ruffled by the prows
of generations of conquerors
who have come,
have ruled, and in their
turn become the dust
blown hither and thither
by the desert wind.</p>

</div>

<p>I found sketching
in the Souks almost
impossible at first, the
people crowded round
me so; but a champion
suddenly appeared in
the shape of an Arab
waiter at the hotel
whose eye fell upon
my easel. I painted, did
I? Et voilà, he too was
devoted to art. Had
he not accompanied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
artists on many expeditions? Was he not an accredited
guide, with patrons in Paris et partout? For six
months he had been guide to an English lady, a great
painter—“Nous avons beaucoup travaillés,” and she had
gained a prize in the Salon for one of her large pictures
painted here, here, in Sfax. “I will accompany you gladly
to the Souks, madame. I can show you all the points
from whence one can make an effective picture. And the
crowds will no longer trouble you. All the world knows
me.” And when I came down in the afternoon there
indeed was Rached ben Mohamed, a white burnous thrown
over his waiter’s clothes, a cigarette in his mouth. He was
as good as his word. From one intricate street to another
he led me, pausing to show me a corner here, a group
there. “This is a magnificent subject,” he would say,
“but not for the afternoon. The shadows are wrong
then. You want a morning light. Tiens! I shall finish
my work always very early and then I am tout à fait à
votre disposition.”</p>

<p>He was an amazing character, much darker than an
Arab, and I suspect his mother of having listened to the
blandishments of a Soudanese. He talked a peculiar French
rather difficult to follow, with terrific rapidity. All the
shopkeepers in the Souks seemed to know him, and he was
treated with great deference as he swaggered past, wrapped
in his burnous, with his crimson fez on one side, talking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
of the great artists he had been with, of the six months he
spent in Paris, of the expeditions he had organised as
guide.</p>

<p>“Comme dessin c’est très joli,” he remarked kindly, on
looking at my first hasty pencil sketch in the Souk aux
Tapis, “ça donne bien l’impression.”</p>

<p>My heart rather failed me when I heard of the great
canvases painted by the French artist. I feared my efforts
would be withered in his scorn, but “vous avez vraiment
du talent,” he pronounced; and much heartened, I dashed
on cobalt and aureolin in a wild effort to reproduce the
brilliance of the scene in front of me.</p>

<p>I was painting in the Street of Stuffs. It was a narrow
way, sloping down to an entrance to the Souks. A ragged
awning was slung from a tumbledown balcony on one side
to the roof of a shop on the other. Brilliant handkerchiefs
and coloured stuffs hung on either side of the pathway;
in the shade of a recess a tailor plied his trade, sitting
cross-legged amongst billows of muslin. The sun beat
down, slatting the roadway with glowing stripes, a continuous
crowd surged up and down, men on their way to
the mosque, countrymen staring at the goods proffered
for sale, blind beggars tapping their way along and calling
“Give, in the name of Allah!” and behind them rose the
slender tower of a minaret.</p>

<p>I squeezed in between two shops and painted valiantly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
whilst Rached kept the crowd from encroaching on me.
He wielded his cane like a scythe from time to time, making
a clean swathe amongst the onlookers. And all the time
he kept up his lordly air, accepting a chair from one, a
cigarette from another, a cup of coffee from a third. He
bullied, he cajoled, or he flattered, and always with success.
I suspect him of assuring the crowd that I was a person of
vast importance. I wondered to myself over his mysterious
employment as a waiter, for a large card hung in the office
setting forth his prowess as a guide. I gathered from him
that if a great artist came along (here a faint underlining
of the adjective) he threw up his waitering, engaged a
substitute in his place, and turned guide for several months
at a time. “Ah yes,” he said, whilst we made our way
back to the hotel down a white side street whose walls
stood sharp against a blinding sky, “to travel is to live.”
He snatched a narcissus from a passing Arab youth and
presented it to me with a flourish, leaving the original
owner too astonished to protest.</p>

<p class="caption">The Souks. Sfax.</p>
<p class="caption">21.2.23.</p>
</div>

<p>At the far end of this narrow way was the Street of the
Coppersmiths with its clang of beaten metal and glow of
heaped copper. A yard out of it was crammed with
mules and donkeys, their bulky saddles piled in a gay
heap in the archway leading to it. Now and again a
laden beast came up the street, its driver shouting to the
crowd to make way. Tattered heaps by the side of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
wall stirred and groaned a petition for alms, the poppy
red of a Spahi’s cloak and his blue pantaloons made a
sudden chip of colour. And everything was soaked in
sunlight.</p>

<p>Midway down the street was a curious white minaret,
topped with metal like a sort of pagoda. At its foot
collected groups buying and selling. The yellow roadway
was sharply cleft with clear-marked shadows, and a
carpenter in a brown burnous sat on the floor of his shop
making axles for cart wheels, a froth of thin shavings
heaped round him. Then a brightly painted cart with
high wheels came past, cleaving a way for itself in some
mysterious manner. Once it and its shouting driver were
past, the crowd flowed together again like water that you
have divided for a moment with a stick, the beggars picked
themselves up from the corners to which they had rolled
for safety, and life went on as usual.</p>

<p>The weather was very uncertain, and now set in for a
cold wet week. I wandered about with my sketch-book
in the covered Souks and finally Rached settled me in a
small shop with the air of conferring a great favour upon
the owner. It dealt in a variety of goods—silks, buttons,
shot, etc. An elderly Arab dressed in a soft dove-coloured
burnous was a customer, and asked if he might offer me a
cup of coffee. I accepted with thanks, whilst in a hissing
whisper the guide conveyed to me the importance of my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
new friend. We talked a little through Rached as interpreter.</p>

<p>The old man told me he was going to Europe in the
spring, for medical treatment as well as for business. He
was a dignified figure in his ample draperies, with thin
fine features. Rached told me afterwards that he was a
big silk merchant, and intended going to London to inspect
silk materials. He and the Kaïd were to travel together,
with Rached as interpreter. A fleeting mental picture
of the trio progressing down Regent Street made me smile
inwardly. Certainly their interpreter would be equal to
any emergency, but how will those dove coloured draperies
fare, and that calm dignity ever survive the Tube or the
rush for a motor bus? The merchant had three wives,
one from Constantinople—“une jeune femme très riche,”
another from Tunis, and a third from his native town of
Sfax. “Elles sont toutes excessivement jolies” asserted
Rached, but I reflected that in a country of veiled women,
probably all men’s wives are beauties. With some interest
I asked how many children there were, but there is only
one girl. “And imagine to yourself how rich she will be,”
sighed the guide, who loved money. But he loved still
better the flinging of it about with a lordly air, so I hardly
think his own daughter will ever be a great partie.</p>

<p>After a short time I began to understand the geography
of the native town, but there were still mysterious alleys<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
that seemed to lead nowhere, shady relatives of the bigger
streets. Close to the city wall was the street of the Pretty
Ladies. Like trap-door spiders one stood in each doorway,
dressed in gay silks, her cheeks rouged, eyebrows painted
to meet in a single line, and tiny black patches on her
face. Most of them were not beautiful. But one doorway
opened into a sort of alcove with a stone seat running round
it, and here we caught sight of three pretty girls in earnest
conversation with one young man. They were dressed in
light silk striped with colours, heavy silver anklets clashed
as they moved and their perfumed hands were heavy with
rings. One turned and glanced at my English companions,
shooting a glance at them from her long-lashed painted eyes,
then drawing her silver veil closer round her with a mock
modesty.</p>

<p>All round the ramparts ran a pathway, and from this
height one looked across the town to the harbour or to the
sea of olives that stretched for miles into the country.
It is a prosperous town and the land round it very rich.
When the almond blossom was out, and all the orchards
on the outskirts of the town a smother of blossom, I motored
about 15 miles into the country, and all the way we ran
through groves and groves of carefully kept olives, till
from a small tower we looked across their grey and silver
stretches to the white distant town of Sfax along the bay.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII<br />
<span class="smaller">OASIS TOWNS</span></h2>

<p>From Sfax I went by train to Gafsa, an inland oasis town
lying most picturesquely in a sandy plain, surrounded by
rocky mountains that rise sheer from it. It is about three
miles from the station of the same name, and the drive to
it leads from the bare plain to the thick olive groves and the
clustering palms that form the oasis. It is just a little
Arab town, with the usual handful of French government
offices and the fort. There are several mosques, and from
the minaret of one I watched the magnificence of the sunset
across the plain. There are more than thirty-eight springs
about here, so the place does not lack water, and every
stream is full of small water tortoises. The remains of the
Roman baths are still to be seen. A group of village
women were washing their jars in the clear blue-green
water, whilst small boys offered to dive for coins.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/illus10.jpg" width="600" height="525" alt="" />
<p class="caption">I. M. D.</p>
<p class="caption">A village Marketplace</p>
</div>

<p>The cultivation of olives is the chief industry of the
place and I went to see a native olive press in the evening.
The air was thick with the heavy cloying smell of oil, and
in the long low building men were turning a press from
which oozed a dark fluid. A smoky lamp was the only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
light, and their dark glistening arms and faces showed up
fitfully as they moved. In the dim light they might have
been denizens of the nether regions, busied over some
horrid rite. From the shadows came the sound of muffled
feet, where the gaunt pale figure of a camel circled interminably,
turning a stone mill that crushed the fruit. Huge
barrels, shining greasily, stood about filled with pure oil.
The ground was slippery and uneven, and a heap of the
crushed skins and pulp lay in the yard outside, staining
the earth a dull crimson.</p>

<p>I seemed to be the only European traveller in the little
town, and my first attempt at finding a hotel had not been
very happy. There had been a doubt as to which to recommend
me, and I had engaged a room by telegram in advance,
but my heart sank as my dilapidated carriage drew up at
it. It looked like a small drinking booth, with a floor of
beaten earth and a few ricketty tables. From the background
appeared a sodden-looking old man, who had
evidently been sampling the hotel wine freely. He took
me across a muddy yard inhabited by dejected hens and
showed me through a rough room full of women ironing
clothes, into a dreadful bedroom strewn with untidy
garments. Out of it opened another which he offered me.
But one glance was sufficient for me and I fled.</p>

<p>The next attempt turned out to be another little café
place, but it had a block of buildings down the street<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
where guests were put up, and which was clean and neat.
No one else, not even a servant, lived in it. I was given
two enormous keys, one for my bedroom and one of the
front door, and after dining in the little café, where a
wooden screen separated me from the Arab clientèle who
were drinking coffee and playing cards, I returned to my
fastness. It struck chill and bare as I locked myself in.
Not a sound. Luckily the furniture was too meagre to
give cover for thieves. There were about ten other rooms
in the building, all empty ... no servants and no means
of calling one. I woke late in the night, thinking I heard
a sound in the passage. The night was pitch dark and
silent, and the village seemed dead. From somewhere
came the drip-drip of water. I listened, but could hear
nothing else, and when I woke next, daylight was struggling
through the curtains. All the accessories for a splendid
ghost story had been there, but fortunately there was no
actor for the chief part.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 250px;">
<img src="images/illus11.jpg" width="250" height="600" alt="" />

</div>

<p>The oasis is very beautiful and my guide said that in the
time of orange blossom one is forced to muffle one’s face
because of the overpowering scent. It may be true. He
was a sallow melancholy Arab youth, who had served at
Salonika and had lost an arm there. He did not talk
much, but warmed up on the subject of his wound and
gave me a horribly realistic account of it. “And why,”
he asked, “were the English fighting the French?” I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
tried to enlighten him,
but with little success.
He had been well cared
for in hospital at
Salonika by a lady
who was very good to
the wounded. French?
He did not know. Perhaps
she was, or English
or German. Anyway
she talked French and
she had wept over his
wounds and had given
him chocolate and had
taught him to write
with his left hand. So
her memory is still
cherished in this remote
little town of Tunisia.
His cousin had also
been sent to the War
and they were always
together. They had
not then felt so alone.
His cousin had made
him promise that if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
he were killed Yousuf must see he was buried as a
good Moslem, and must write and tell his family.
Should it be Yousuf who fell, then Ali would carry
out the same good offices for him. They were together
when there was a loud explosion and his cousin fell
upon his face. The boy ran to pick him up and found
him dead, and casting up his hands in despair, at that
moment he himself was struck and his arm torn off. When
he came to himself the stretcher-bearers were carrying
him away. And he said “Take also my cousin, for I
must see that he has proper burial,” but they answered
“We must take you first,” and so he was carried into the
darkness and never saw Ali’s body again. “What could
I have done? They would not listen to me, and I know
not how my poor cousin was buried. Ah! he knew that
he would not live,” said Yousuf. “When we first put on
gas-masks, then Ali wept, for he felt Death touch him.
And so it happened.” He was silent.</p>

<p>As we rode, a sudden storm of rain came up. The
mountains were blotted out, and a tiny marabou stood
out startlingly white of a sudden against the blue black of
the clouds. Two pigeons flew across them looking like
bits of white paper, a heavy drop or two fell, digging deep
into the loose sand, the palms stood motionless waiting,
and then with a great rush came the rain.</p>

<p>From there I was going on to Tozeur, and the only train<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
left at the dreadful hour of 5 a.m. Motors were non-existent,
so I had to start for the station soon after 4 a.m.
in a cross between a hearse and a bathing machine known
as the hotel omnibus. I shared it with various muffled
figures who emerged sleepily one by one from blank
shuttered houses on the way. Usually they first had to be
wakened by loud thumps on the door and shouts that we
could not wait for them. It felt like a dream, and I
wondered if perhaps I had got into some enchanted place
which I could never leave again. Supposing we were
to miss the train, how often might not this performance be
repeated? I became aggressively English and determined.
At the last stopping place I declared if I were kept waiting
any longer I should complain to the Contrôle Civile. I
was rather vague as to the power I was threatening to
unleash, but the mere thought of it roused the driver and
Yousuf to a frenzy of action. They rushed simultaneously
upon the barred door and kicked and knocked to such
purpose that the last traveller appeared blinking and still
arranging his turban. And then when we got to the
station, the train was late and we had half an hour to wait.</p>

<p>As I steamed away across the wide stretches of tawny
plain with the dark blur of the oasis of Gafsa in the distance
and the mountains already turning purple in the
sickly dawn, the unreality of the place seemed to accentuate
itself in my mind. Had I really been there? Really<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
wandered through the oasis, and watched the troops of
camels coming along the dried river bed? Really heard
the call of the muezzin across the sleeping Arab town?
Or had it all been a dream? I scarcely knew.</p>

<p>It was wet when I reached Tozeur, and I stumbled down
sandy roads in a chill rain, to the hotel. It was more the
oasis of one’s imagination than anything I had yet seen.
Beyond the thick grove of palm and fruit trees and the little
native town built of earth bricks there stretched a great
waste of yellow sand, in which the modern station buildings
stood absurdly by themselves. To the east there glistened
the vast Shott, a kind of quicksand with a salty crust.
There are safe tracks across it for camels and mules, but
a step to right or left may engulf the unwary traveller. In
the distance it looks like an immense lake, the salt surface
shining like water, and after rain it does become a shallow
lake in places. It has been a terror to travellers for many
generations, and rumour exaggerated its dangers. One of the
earliest accounts of it was written in the fourteenth century,
by Abou Yaga Zakkaria, who told terrible stories of hundreds
of camels being swallowed up and leaving no trace,
through straying from the safe path. All round it
stretches a sandy solitude, broken only by the dark palm
groves of Tozeur, and far away, those of Nefta.</p>

<p class="caption">Grain Market. Tozeur.</p>
</div>

<p>All this part is called the Djerid, and here one feels the
intense solitude of the desert. It is on the edge of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
Sahara. In summer the heat is terrific, and the air vibrates
as above an oven. The small town is surrounded by a
sea of sand; the streets are ankle deep in it, and it stretches
as far as one can see. It is picturesque, the houses built
of earthen bricks set in patterns and with arched and
tunnelled passages. ‘Town’ is rather a misleading term;
it is just a collection of buildings clustering round a market-place,
the roads wandering off vaguely from it into the
desert.</p>

<p>The oasis is beautiful, streams of blue-green water everywhere,
and a tangle of fruit trees amongst the slender
trunks of the palms. It is about 2,500 acres in extent,
the dates being renowned for their flavour. Alas! all
were exported, and as unprocurable as fresh fish at a
seaside resort. A minaret near a door covered with green
tiles caught the eye, but most of the buildings were low
and only remarkable for the picturesque way in which the
bricks were set, forming attractive designs. The grain
market was held under a modern roof, but the rest was in
the open air, and the wide space was covered with an
immense crowd. The women dressed in dark blue cotton
with one white stripe the length of it, and they held the
head covering across their faces. There is a large admixture
of negro blood, which has spoilt the Arab type.</p>

<p>The population is occupied almost entirely in the care
of the date palms. When first planted the small tree is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
watered once a day and sheltered from cold winds. It
begins to bear a little when 10 or 12 years old. From the
age of 20 it produces an annual harvest of fruit and at 30
it is at its greatest vigour and continues in full bearing for
another 30 years or so. Then its produce lessens by degrees
and it is used for the extraction of palm wine or <i>nagmi</i>
as it is called; but this is only practised on trees whose
yield is poor, or which are already worn out.</p>

<p>Truly the palm is the Arab’s friend. The fruit is his
staple food; its leaves are made into baskets and panniers,
or serve as hedges, its stem for gate posts and the beams of
houses; while the fibrous stuff that is near the root is
made into rope, mattresses and a sort of cloth. Even the
date stones are eaten by camels. The Arabs have a saying
that were a camel to walk into a palm grove, he could
come out completely equipped with bridle, saddle and
panniers and even with the palm leaf stem as a whip. It
is in a palm-leaf cradle that the desert Arab is rocked to
sleep as a child; his life passes below its shade, and it is
under boards of its wood that he takes his last rest.</p>

<p>Twenty-four kilometres from Tozeur is the little town
of Nefta. I motored there on a beaten road across the
stretches of sand. To our left the Shott shone like a
great lake, streaked with faint grey and purple. As far
as we could see, the desert stretched away interminably
till it met the horizon. The track followed the telegraph<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
posts, and we passed a few groups of Arabs with their
camels, plodding along at a pace which they can keep up
for days at a stretch. One seemed to be moving for ever
through an immense space, almost with a feeling of being
hypnotised. Then, ahead, there was a dark blur in the
expanse. “Voilà Nefta!” said the chauffeur.</p>

<p>It is entirely an Arab town, the flat-topped houses and
the clothes of the inhabitants all of the same colour as the
surrounding sand. Thick groves of palms cluster along
the streams that flow from a quantity of springs. The
oasis is called the ‘corbeille’ and is aptly named, for it
lies in a hollow over which the village, straggling along
two small heights, looks down. The palms grow all up
the edges of this cup, and through their stems one sees
the glow of sand against a pale blue sky. Springs of clear
water bubbled up everywhere in the oasis and round the
feet of the palms was the tender green of growing things.
Bushes of white jasmine scented the air. And within a
stone’s throw of this verdure is the vast emptiness and
silence of the desert. Far, far on the horizon, like the
tender tints of Venetian glass, was the pale blue and rose
of distant rocky hills.</p>

<p>The tiny hotel was in the market-place, and from its
verandah we looked down on an animated scene. Camels
laden with firewood came in from the far country, driven
by uncouth-looking men wrapped in ragged cloaks, their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
feet covered with rough shoes made of camel’s hide tied
round the ankle. Tiny children, naked but for their one
hooded garment, crept to warm themselves by the fires
where cooking was going on. The people seemed very poor,
their clothes tattered and scanty. Small booths were
set up in the market-place, where unappetising meat was
sold, and flat loaves of bread. One shopman dealt in
primitive rings set with beads, sheathed knives and the
flat mirrors that the Arab woman loves to wear hung
round her neck. Far into the night I heard the sound of
voices in the market-place below, and caught the occasional
flicker of a fire.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 325px;">
<img src="images/illus13.jpg" width="325" height="400" alt="" />
<p class="caption">I. M. D.</p>
</div>

<p>Nefta seemed full of children, queer little elfin figures in
their pointed hoods with their thin unchildlike faces.
There had been three bad harvests in succession, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
everyone was poor and hungry. I watched a tiny boy
of about four years old who was left on guard over a heap
of grass straw that his father had brought for sale. The
little creature took his task very solemnly and hour after
hour he sat there gravely, his trailing garment folded over
his bare feet. It turned very cold as the sun went down,
but still the small Casabianca stuck to his post. It began
to grow dusk, and yet he sat there motionless, his eyes
fixed on the bundles of straw. I thought how pleasant
it would be to slip a coin or two into his frozen hands and
started out full of this benevolent intention. But the
sight of me was more than the poor little hero could stand.
He had faced cold and hunger and the danger of possible
thieves, but the terrifying sight of a white woman in
strange garments was too much for him. He stood his
ground bravely for a moment, but as it became certain I
was coming straight to him, he fled, but hovered nearby
in terror and perplexity like some shy bird whose nest is
approached. I held up the money for him to see, but he
did not understand. It proved useless to try to coax
him back, and I went away, watching from a distance for
his return. Like the bird, he slipped back to his post in
the dusk as soon as he thought me safely gone, and now I
waited till his father had appeared and then tried again.
Again he wavered and turned to run as I drew near, but
the father understood my gestures and caught him, smiling,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
by a flying end of his cloak. And so he stood, frightened
but valiant, whilst I closed his tiny cold hand over the
coins. I left him still bewildered, and could only hope the
money served to buy a hot supper and perhaps firewood
for the family.</p>

<p>Next day I rode along the route to Tougourt, in Algeria,
a nine days’ journey by caravan. There seemed nothing
to mark the road from the ocean of sand. It was edged
in some places with a low parapet of banked sand and dry
grass. Far below us was the dark mass of the ‘corbeille’
and above it the village of Nefta with its irregular line of
houses, pricked here and there by a minaret and dotted
with the white bubbles of marabou. On the other side,
desert. The red-roofed douane on the frontier between
Algeria and Tunis, looked like a child’s forgotten toy. Far
off the minute silhouettes of distant camels paced slowly
across the immensity. The air was clear and thin. One
seemed alone in the world.</p>

<p>And suddenly, there at our feet we saw the delicate faces
of tiny crocus-like flowers gazing at us from the level of
the sand itself. Flushed with a faint lavender, the slender
stamens stained with orange, they seemed indeed a miracle.
From what nutriment had they woven their frail loveliness?
The sand was friable and bare, the cold winds of night must
pass like a scythe over these lonely places. But
mysteriously, defying the vast world, minute trembling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
roots must have crept from the small bulbs, mooring the
little plants to a firm anchorage. And the first few drops
of warm rain had brought them to a fragile flowering.
Crushed by the spongy feet of passing camels, unregarded,
ignored, they spread their delicate carpet, earnest of the
later more bounteous gifts of Spring. And in this land
of life reduced to bare necessities, of a people living from
hand to mouth, of the harsh nomad existence led by
Bedouin tribes, these little flowers seemed a message linking
us to a more gracious existence, a land of kindlier aspect,
of softer skies, with its largesse of blossoms of which the
desert knows nothing.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII<br />
<span class="smaller">THE SAND DIVINER</span></h2>

<p>The little oasis town of Gabès is on the coast, quite in the
south of Tunisia, the line to it being made by German
prisoners during the War. After leaving the broad belt
of cultivation that stretches some way out of Sfax, with
its olives and corn and fruit trees, the train ran through
bare open country with scattered flocks of cattle, sheep
or camels grazing on a sparse and wiry grass. Here and
there a few Arabs were laboriously tilling the soil with
wooden ploughs drawn by lean bullocks or camels. The
latter are harnessed by means of a broad band of sacking
across the front of their humps, attached by ropes to the
plough. But soon these signs of cultivation ceased, and
I looked out on a sandy and desolate waste, only broken
occasionally by tracts of rough grass, stretching to a far
dove-coloured sky. We reached Gabès in the dark. All
night a storm raged, and I heard the thunder of waves on
the shore and the wind and the rain lashing the palm trees
of the oasis. The next day it was still stormy, and
the public garden opposite the hotel was bruised and
battered, whilst the palms looked dishevelled and untidy
with their hair all over their eyes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>

<p>Gabès is a very small place, just the French military
cantonments, one street, and a few houses and shops. A
little river flows into the sea here, and on its other bank
is the oasis, full of running water and palms and fruit trees.
I rode for a long way through it. Arabs were at work
amongst the vegetable gardens or tending the palms. Some
of the trees are tapped for the juice, which is made into an
intoxicating drink. When drawn off, it is colourless and
clear and very sweet. The top of the palm is cut off, a
hole made down the centre and a jar put into it. This
fills itself every twelve hours or so. The tree is treated
in this way every two years three times, and it does the
growth no harm. One can see by the notches in the stem
where it has been cut.</p>

<p>About a mile and a half from Gabès are the queer little
villages of Jarette and Vielle Jarette, the latter built
largely of stone from Roman ruins. They consist of a
perfect rabbit warren of native houses with passage-ways
leading from one to the other, buttressed with old stone
pillars. Huge blocks of carved stone, fragments of
acanthus, etc., are built into the walls. I went into one
minute interior, where two girls sat on the earth floor
weaving at a hand loom, whilst another was grinding corn
in a stone hand-mill. They took a deep interest in me
and fingered my fur coat in astonishment. They were
broad featured, with very thick wavy hair, and were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
covered with jewellery. My guide Mansour tells me the
Arabs cannot understand why European women wear so
few gems.</p>

<p>“Your ladies do not trouble to make themselves beautiful,
do they?” said he. “With us, the women take so
much trouble that even the plain make themselves
handsome.”</p>

<p>He was an excellent guide, energetic and intelligent,
talking French well, and had been a good deal with Englishmen
on various shooting expeditions, so understood English
ways.</p>

<p>I found the market-place of Jarette very interesting to
sketch. There was always a great crowd in the morning,
selling meat, vegetables, grain, tiny dried fish, poultry,
etc. The walls were mostly mud coloured and the men
in clothes the colour of earth, too, with only now and again
the bright red or blue of a woman’s veil, or the striped
skirt they wear in Gabès. But the brilliance of the sun
made the whole scene sparkle and glow. The alley way
in which I sometimes sat was roofed with palm leaf, through
which one saw chinks of deep blue sky. The walls seemed
to throb with refracted light, and at the end of the shadowed
tunnel was a vignette of the busy market-place, sharp and
clear in the intense sunlight. Figures squatted round
wares arranged on the ground, others strode past carrying
bags of grain. Here a negro was selling oranges, or a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
butcher auctioning pieces of horrid carmine to an intent
crowd. Small boys looking like gnomes in their pointed
hoods, with brown faces and bare legs, tiny girls carrying
solemn-eyed babies, the black mysterious figures of veiled
women, or a group of lightly veiled village girls coming past
with a swing of drooping earrings and shapely arms holding
burdens on their shoulder, swinging blue and red draperies,
long dark eyes, and the blue tattoo marking on chin and
cheek considered beautiful. Working away at my sketch
I got a vague yet distinct picture in my mind of them as
they passed; and the little donkeys, ridden by figures
sitting on the rump and keeping up a flail-like motion of
yellow slippered feet against their dusky sides, and shouting
“Aarr-r-rh!”</p>

<p>All was bustle and excitement, and under the shelter
of my roofed way were stacks of green vegetables and
the cool purple and cream of turnips. The sunshine
permeated everything outside, flooded market-place and
crowd in a torrent of light, not golden, but a brilliant clear
light in which things stood out sharply etched and distinct.
A North African winter sunshine, amazingly brilliant, yet
without much heat. The sun had not yet become the
tyrant of summer, when men fly from his rays, and night
becomes little less breathless than the day, when palms hang
motionless in the sultry glare and people leave their mud
dwellings for the shade of the oasis, when the glittering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
sea breaks on a blinding beach, and the earth lies panting
and scorched. These are the days, I suppose, when the
mind turns with longing to the grey washes of rain in
England, to the cool depths of summer woods and the
freshness of clear springs amongst green ferns. For the
shadow of a rock in a weary land.</p>

<p>On my way back from the market-place one day I
passed an old sand-diviner, who sat wrapped in his neutral-coloured
robes by the roadside, foretelling the mysteries of
the future to a negress who squatted in front of him,
evidently come on behalf of her mistress. On his knee
he held a large book, and in front of him was the little
wooden tray spread with sand, in which he made mysterious
signs with his fingers. He was a kindly-looking old man,
wrinkled and brown, his grey beard giving him a reverend
appearance. He gave me permission to sketch him, and
went on with his fortune telling. Sometimes he would
look at his book and then peer with his mild eyes into the
blue of the sky above his head, whilst the woman watched
his movements with apprehension. I finished the sketch
of him and he was delighted with it, and said:</p>

<p>“Put under it that my name is El Haj Hassim ben
Abdallah Na Hali and that I can tell all things. I know all
the stars by name and the power they have over each
man’s fate. Nothing is hid from me.”</p>

<p class="caption">El Haj Hassin ben Abdulla Na Hali: Sand Diviner.</p>
<p class="caption">Gabès. 11.1.23.</p>
</div>

<p>I told Mansour to ask him if he could tell what had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
passed in my life, and listened, smiling, for his answer.
First he must know my name and the name of my mother.
After repeating them with great difficulty he smoothed
the sand in his tray and marked it six times with his
finger. Then he looked up to the sky for a time, and spoke:</p>

<p>“This lady has a hard head; she does not easily believe.
She loves to see new things and to travel to strange lands.
Six countries has she already seen and yet more will she
visit. Many times has she crossed great waters, once in
peril of her life. She has been married, and he who was
her husband is dead. Six men have been her friends—”
(A little nervous as to the possible signification of the
Arab word ‘friend,’ I hastily repudiated the last statement)—“and
one will take her to a far country and will
leave her there. It is spoken.”</p>

<p>Fortunately my hard head prevented my being much
perturbed by the unpleasantness of the last part of the
prophecy, but I was much charmed by the old man and
his simplicity. Every day he sits there, his gentle face
bent over his book, and from far and near people come to
consult him. Mansour was distressed that I had not
taken his speech more seriously.</p>

<p>“Of a truth he knows everything; I when young went
to consult him, for I was greatly in love with a beautiful
girl whom I wanted to marry. So great was her beauty
that I could neither eat nor sleep for the thought of her.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
But the Sand-diviner said: ‘Lo, my son, put all thought
of her from thy mind, for she will never be thine, not even
wert thou to lay a bag of gold at her feet would she look
upon thee.’ And it was even as he said. She would not
look upon me. And for the space of five months I was
grievously ill because of the love I bore her. Thus do I
know the Sand-diviner speaks truth.”</p>

<p>We trudged along the dusty road in silence and then I
ventured to ask if he had married someone else, and the
cheerfulness of his answer relieved my anxiety. Yes, he
was married, and his wife was “une vraie Arabe,” for
she made herself beautiful for him, and three times in the
week she went to the baths and perfumed herself, “and
this she will continue to do,” he remarked, “till she has
children. Then will she have no other thought but of her
babes, for is not this the nature of women?” he ended
philosophically.</p>

<p>He told me later that he had had three wives (he was a
man of about 28, I think) and his first two he had divorced
because they did not get on with his mother. “But one
of them I shall marry again when my parents are no longer
alive, for I am very fond of her, and she is waiting for me.”
He explained to me that the first duty of a Moslem is to
his parents. He brings his wife back to the paternal house,
and unless there are too many children they live there till
the death of the older generation. In any case a son must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
support his parents all the days of their life. It is not
forbidden to a Moslem to marry a Christian, there is much
in the Bible that is also in the Koran. But never may the
Mohammedans have anything to do with the Jews. They
are an accursed people, a people set apart——</p>

<p>On my way to sketch one day, I saw an Arab funeral at
the graveyard and watched for a time. The body, wrapped
in folds of stuff and covered with a red cloth, lay on a light
bier carried shoulder high, followed by a procession of men
intoning verses from the Koran. There was a service held
at the grave side, the professional mourners sitting in a
circle chanting and swaying backwards and forwards.
In this case it was the funeral of a woman, but no women
were there, their presence not being allowed by custom.
The foot of the grave had been bricked round and the corpse
was taken from the bier and laid sideways in it, being then
bricked in and the earth filled in on the top. The leader
of the procession went round giving money to each of its
members, and one by one the mourners condoled with the
eldest son, kissing him on the shoulder.</p>

<p>Mansour watched from afar, for the dead woman was the
mother of a friend of his, and he should have been attending
the funeral.</p>

<p>“Life is but a short gift,” he said, “and soon over. To
each of us must come an hour like this. We come from the
dark and we enter the dark again.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span></p>

<p>He told me the near relatives of the deceased must take
off all jewellery, must fast for two days, and for the space of
several months must not cut their hair nor attend entertainments
of any sort. I asked how soon a man usually
re-married after his wife’s death and was told in about
six months’ time. He was shocked at our English custom
of two years of widowhood. “It is not good for man to
live alone,” he remarked sententiously.</p>

<p>On the death of one of the family, the women shriek
and tear their faces with their nails. Everything is taken
out of the room and the body is wrapped in a fine cloth
and laid on a mattress on the ground, with its face towards
Mecca, where it is visited by relations and friends. The
burial takes place within twenty-four hours of death.
When the corpse is lifted on to the bier, all children who
are too young to talk are taken away from the home,
there being a popular belief that they might hear the three
cries said to be given by the dead when leaving his dwelling
place, and so become dumb. Many willing helpers give
assistance in carrying the bier, the Koran promising the
remission of ten sins for every step taken in this way.
It also promises forgiveness of a sin to all who follow in the
procession. A piece of reed is placed in the tomb, containing
copies of the prayer recommending the soul of the
dead to the angels who will enquire of him regarding his
orthodoxy. The assistants, before the grave is filled in,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
say, “Thou hast come from the earth, and to the earth
thou returnest, whither we shall follow thee.” They each
throw a handful of earth into the tomb, and it is then
filled in, the gravedigger, when his work is finished, crying,
“May he be forgiven!” The near relatives may cook no
food for three days after the death, but may eat of what is
brought to them. On the third day, readers of the Koran
recite verses of it in the house of mourning, and the
ceremonials are then finished.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX<br />
<span class="smaller">THE CIRCUS</span></h2>

<p>There had been great excitement for some days past
amongst the Arab children in the little oasis town.
Mysterious vans had arrived by the train which crept once
a day across the wide stretches of desert country, looking
in the distance like a caterpillar with gleaming eyes before
it drew up in the dusk at the tiny station. The children
hung about watching till they were dispersed by an
important-looking official.</p>

<p>It had not been so very long ago that the train itself had
been a new excitement, bringing a whiff of modern civilisation
to this small outpost on the edge of the desert. This
was as far as the railway had reached as yet, and the station
buildings had a somewhat bewildered air, set down in
space with nothing but desert beyond them, and only the
frail thread of the line to connect them with the far-off stir
of modern life. And now it seemed it was bringing something
tangible and wonderful. There were placards in
French and in Arabic announcing the arrival of a Grand
World Circus, and performances were to be held three
nights running in the town.</p>

<p>The small Arabs talked of nothing else. What was a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
circus? It leaked out that there were wonderful European
boys who rode on winged horses with flowing tails; there
were men who walked in mid-air on wires as fine as the
threads of a spider’s web. There were animals that could
talk. There were clowns. What were clowns? Above
all, there was a marvellously beautiful princess who also
walked in mid-air, light as thistledown and graceful as a
houri. A town crier with a drum paraded the only street
shouting out the attractions of the circus and distributing
handbills printed in Arabic. Grave men studied these
solemnly over their tiny cups of black coffee, whilst the
children edged nearer and nearer, gleaning crumbs of
information. “Lo, the cost of a seat is one franc; it is
much money,” said one greybeard to another. But again
and again the words of the handbill drew their eyes back.
“Hassan hath seen such an exhibition at Tunis, and he
saith it is more marvellous even than the paper sets forth.”</p>

<p>Early every morning the children collected in the station
square watching for what might happen. One day there
were bales of stuff lying on the ground, and men were hard
at work driving in poles and tent pegs and little by little
a great tent rose in the square itself and a watchman took
up his position in front of it to prevent all from entering.
Next a party of strangers arrived and excitement grew to
fever point. The new comers lodged at a tiny hotel and
few caught sight of them. From a smaller tent close by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
the large one came the sound of horses stamping, and a
boy lying full length on the ground and peering under the
edge of it, declared his face had been brushed by a long and
silky tail that touched the ground. Then it was true about
the wonderful horses! Excited small boys chattered hard,
and the booking of seats became furious. Along the dusty
roads came knots of peasants from outlying mud villages,
fingering their cherished coins. The fat Frenchman at
the table outside the tent took a stream of money all day
long and smiled, well pleased.</p>

<p>Down by the grey-green river where the women beat
and pounded linen in the clear running water, there was
talk of little else. Their husbands and brothers and sons
would see the circus. They themselves, being women,
could not go. But that did not prevent their being intensely
interested in the coming event.</p>

<p>“It is said they be in league with the Evil One and thus
it is they can walk in mid air,” said one woman, busily
wringing out a dark blue strip of muslin. “Allah send
that our menfolk come to no harm in going to see them.”</p>

<p>“It is truly spoken,” the others answered, and there was
a pause for a moment in the unceasing chatter, whilst a
passing breeze stirred the palm leaves in the oasis across
the stream and set the sandy soil whirling in small eddies.</p>

<p>It was a day in mid-January and already the almond
blossom was beginning to show a delicate flush among the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
palm stems, and the naked grey fig trees were putting
forth small emerald leaves. On the wide seashore the
waves were coming in gently, pushing a ring of creamy
froth ahead of them, and there was a softness in the air
and a greater warmth in the sun’s rays. The short African
winter was almost over.</p>

<p>As the evening drew on, flaring naphtha lamps made a
blaze of light at the entrance of the circus tent, and hours
before the entertainment was to begin a crowd began to
collect, the more fortunate clutching their tickets, the rest prepared
to wait outside through the whole performance on the
chance of catching a glimpse of the wonderful sights within.</p>

<p>Darkness came with its usual rush and through the
curved leaves of the eucalyptus trees in the hotel garden
shone the faint glimmer of stars. As we stepped into the
open air the far-off beat of the sea seemed a steady pulse
in the night. Our feet fell softly on the sandy road, and
ahead of us was the glow of the circus. A packed crowd
surrounded it, the light catching on dark faces and flowing
draperies. Huddled in their cloaks they were impassive in
appearance, but in reality deeply stirred. All eyes were turned
to the tent, from the chinks of which came a heartening orange
glow that spoke of the hidden glories within, whilst the
shaky strains of a band made themselves heard at intervals.</p>

<p>The setting of the entertainment was meagre in the
extreme. The Box Office sat on a chair by a rickety<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
wooden table, and occasionally rushed forth to chase away
inquisitive boys who were approaching too near the
mysteries. Inside there were three or four tiers of rough
seats round the low canvas edging that circled the ring.
On one side were the reserved seats, occupied by French
officers of the small garrison and their wives, glad of even
this simple distraction, shopkeepers, railway officials, and
the richer Arabs. On the other side were rows and rows
of natives packed as closely as possible along the benches,
whilst the children sat on lower seats still, staring round
them at the tent and up to the dim gloom of the roof, where
a trapeze hung motionless. The ring was uncovered
beaten earth, and naphtha lights illuminated the scene
with a crude glare.</p>

<p>When all the seats were filled, the band, composed of a
violin, a cornet, and a most useful drum, set up a martial
air. There was a tightening up of the tense excitement
amongst the children, and to a burst of ardour on the part
of the drum, a grey horse cantered easily into the arena.
His flowing tail almost swept the ground and from his
arched neck rippled a long and silky mane. Striding
after him came the Master of the Ceremonies, with his
long whip and air of distinction. And with him came a
scrap of a boy in a fringed khaki costume that strove to
give him a Red Indian air. A scarlet handkerchief was
knotted round his head. Round and round the ring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
went the horse, with an easy regular canter, until the crowd
broke into exclamations of admiration. Had such an
animal ever been seen before in the little town? “Truly
it was such a steed as the son of a prince might ride,”
said one to another. Then there was a fresh stir of interest
as the tiny khaki figure ran to meet it, seemed to cling for
a moment against its side, then threw a small leg across its
back and sat upright, waving an acknowledgment to the
applause. To the crack of the Master’s long whip that
rang out like a pistol shot, the horse kept up his easy
canter, whilst one by one the boy performed his tricks,
standing on one leg, lying full length and picking up flags
from the ground as he rode past, jumping over hurdles, etc.,
his small face set and grave under the folds of the scarlet
handkerchief, intent on performing his task correctly.
The crowd clapped delighted, till at last he and his steed
disappeared in a storm of applause. Then talk rose
again in a buzz. “Verily Hassan spoke truth when he
said we should see marvels,” and there were murmurs that
the turn was over too quickly. In the more expensive seats
they discussed the show patronisingly and declared it not
at all bad. Someone said it was a small family affair, this
French travelling-circus, and that the performers worked
hard and made it pay. “A wretched life,” he added.</p>

<p>Meanwhile from my seat near the gangway I could watch
the performers as they came on and overhear snatches of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
talk. As the grey and its rider went out they passed a
knot of people talking together. “Canst thou manage it,
Etienne?” said a woman’s anxious voice, and at the same
moment two clowns appeared laughing and bandying
jokes. One of them, the elder, was so drawn and haggard,
it seemed with pain, that it could be marked even through
the thick white make-up on his face. He was in the
usual baggy white costume; whilst the other, tall and
young, was dressed absurdly in a short black jacket, with
a turndown collar and flowing red bow tie, and wide
checked trousers. His face, with its twinkling humorous
eyes and wide slit mouth was reddened to the hue of a
rosy apple, whilst his fair curly hair stood up in tufts above
it. It could easily be seen he clowned for the love of it.
He chaffed the audience, even drawing laughter from the
Arab part of it, asked absurd questions of the Master of the
Ceremonies, tried to perform feats of horsemanship and
failed grotesquely, only to do something finally much
more difficult than he had at first attempted.</p>

<p>But after a time a certain restlessness began to make
itself felt amongst the audience. Good as the clowns were,
the crowd was looking for the appearance of the Enchantress,
the wonderful Princess of the Air. Expectation, whetted
by what had already been seen, became more and more keen.</p>

<p>At last there was a stir outside, a pause, a crashing of
chords on the part of the Band, and running forward with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
quick little steps, smiling to left and right, her dark hair
hanging down her back, her candid eyes seeming to beg a
kind reception from the crowd, she appeared.</p>

<p>She was dressed in scarlet tights, her arms bare to the
shoulder, and by her side trotted a small boy, dressed too in
red. With all her bravery of gaudy apparel and in spite
of her professional ingratiating smile, there was still so
much of the honest bourgeoise wife and mother about her
that she struck one as incongruous. What queer chance
had shaped her life to this? She came on with an air of
competent quiet assurance. She was a large woman, with
well-shaped sturdy limbs, and a wedding ring gleamed
on her plump hand. She stepped into the arena, smiling all
round, and I saw her surreptitiously pat the small boy’s foot
as she lifted him into the trapeze and followed him herself.</p>

<p>Then came a really wonderful performance. She swung
at a perilous height, knelt on the swaying swing, hung head
downwards from it by her knees, her long hair streaming
in a straight sweep from her head. The applause was
tremendous. Sitting astride the bar she kissed her hand
to the audience, then she and the small boy went on with
their evolutions in mid air. Sometimes he threw himself
into space, to be caught by her hanging hands, or he
stood on her shoulders whilst they swung dizzily backwards
and forwards above our heads. And all the time she had
that air of an honest bourgeoise conscientiously giving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
the audience full value for their money. This Enchantress
of the Air, this wonderful Princess the rumour of whose
exploits had set a small town dreaming of romance, about
whose scarlet-clad figure in the eyes of the Arab audience
still clung the glamour of far-off cities and of unknown
lands beyond the sea: for many a night she would haunt
the dreams of the wide-eyed children in the audience, with
that magic that had been first roused by the music of her
high-sounding names, then strengthened by her strange
apparel, and the ease and sureness which she displayed.
Could one use such a word in connection with her solid person,
one might say she had ‘flashed’ upon their consciousness,
a being from another world, something jewelled and rare.
And still she looked down, smiling, from the height above us.</p>

<p>The haggard looking clown had a part too to take in the
acrobatic performance. He came to rub his feet in a heap
of chalk near the gangway, and I could see tiny points of
perspiration pricking through the make-up on his face. I
knew he feared lest he should break down and I watched
anxiously as he joined the performers. First he handed a
chair up to the woman as she stood on the swing, and
balancing it by two legs she sat on it, turning and twisting
whilst all eyes were rivetted on her. Her calm and assurance
seemed to uphold and steady the man. He and she and
the boy did wonderful acrobatic tricks, but even at that
distance I could mark the tension about his whitened face.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
Once or twice he missed his spring, but she remained serene
and quiet and smiled encouragement to him.</p>

<p>The performance was gone through steadily, and then
came the last pose, that set the nerves tingling. He
stood on the swinging bar, she on his shoulder, and above
her the small figure of the boy with a foot on either side
her head. The veins stood out on the man’s neck from the
immense strain, and though it was only for a moment they
stayed, arms stretched out like a swaying human ladder,
it was a relief when they slid safely to the ground.</p>

<p>Next came a ‘turn’ again with two horses. The Enchantress
stood in the gangway next me, resting, her arms
folded. She told me the Infant Prodigy was her son, and
that she had four other children, one of them the boy rider
we had seen. She spoke frankly and pleasantly. Yes, it was
a hard life; they went from town to town, staying a few
nights in each, but they earned their living, and after all, “il
faut travailler, n’est ce pas?” She smiled, and moved away.
An honest soul in that large figure, undoubtedly; kindly
and conscientious. Her firm cheeks glowed with colour, her
dark eyes had a direct gaze, and her bare arms were shapely
and white. Her natural setting seemed some small shop in
a provincial town, or perhaps the parlour of a country inn.</p>

<p>Later, she came on again, but this time it was the Infant
Prodigy who was the chief performer. The Master of the
Ceremonies appeared in flannels, balancing a long pole on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
his shoulder, and up this the little figure crept inch by inch,
till at last he sat on the top, a tiny spot of crimson in the
glare of the lamps. His mother watched him anxiously
whilst the rest of the troupe stood round looking on. At
a given signal the music stopped and the boy cautiously
let himself head downwards along the pole, clasping the
top of it with his feet. There was a sharp intake of breath
all round the tent. One small foot felt for a ring at the top
of the pole, and sidled its way through it up to the ankle.
Then the little creature spread himself out, only touching
the supporting pole with the tip of one hand.</p>

<p>All this time, in the dead silence, the man kept the pole
balanced, moving slightly backwards and forwards, moisture
running down his face with the effort. There was an
attempt at applause, but it was checked. The moment
was too critical. At last the child straightened himself up
again almost imperceptibly, gently drew his foot free from
the ring and slid triumphantly to the ground, whilst the
clapping broke out with redoubled vigour.</p>

<p>It was the last item on the programme and whilst the Master
made a flowery French speech to the audience, the Enchantress
reappeared—a cotton gown over her professional
garments, and methodically went the round of the tent
making a collection in a china plate. In this dress she became
matter-of-fact. It was hard to connect her with the scarlet
figure that had held our interest chained so short a time ago.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span></p>

<p>People began to leave, streaming out into the darkness.
The artistes were clearing away the few stage properties
whilst the musicians wrapped up their instruments, and turning
back as I left the tent I saw the little Prodigy slipping
his hand into his mother’s and trotting off to be put to bed.</p>

<p>The air outside struck chill after the stuffy heat of the
tent. From the distance came a faint sound of native
music and fireworks celebrating an Arab wedding. Hooded
figures muffled in cloaks passed silently as ghosts. The
sharp rustle of palm leaves made itself heard in the darkness,
and clear on the night came the notes of a bugle from
the military cantonment on the edge of the little town.
Groups of Arabs stood about discussing the wonders of the
evening with those who had not been able to get a seat,
whilst small boys hung wistfully about the entrance, loth
to leave the enchanted spot and to return to everyday life.</p>

<p>Long after the circus has left the country, and the Prodigy
has grown up, there will be talk of it in the mud houses
along the river bank and in the village market-places. And
as the tale spreads from one hearer to another, its marvels
will become ever more and more wonderful, and slimmer
and more beautiful the heroine, till she and the satin-coated
horses and the small boy-acrobat will take their
places amongst that gallery of half-mythical figures, almost
divine, of whom stories are told round flickering village
fires in the dusk.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X<br />
<span class="smaller">ROUND ABOUT GABÈS</span></h2>

<p>There is a beautiful stretch of sand along the small Bay
of Gabès strewn with shells and pieces of coarse sponge,
brought in by the tide. Sponge fisheries are found further
south, but the variety at Gabès itself is of no good. There
are tunny fisheries here, and also a trade in shell fish carried
on with Marseilles. The little river is frequented by native
fishermen who use hand nets which they throw with great
skill. The net is circular and draws up close together when
in the hand. When thrown it opens wide on reaching the
water and sinks owing to its leaded edge. After leaving it
for a few minutes the fisherman pulls it in, the strain on
the cord closing the mouth again. As a fisher is stationed
at every few yards, I do not think the fish population can
be a large one.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/illus15.jpg" width="500" height="600" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Women Washing</p>
<p class="caption">I. M. D.</p>
</div>

<p>Further up the river the women collect to do their washing,
and make picturesque groups in their blue and red
garments. They use both hands and feet to pommel and
wring the clothes, and beat them with the stem of a palm
leaf. Some have soap, but many use only a kind of earth,
and all the washing is done in the cold running water of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
the stream. They chatter like a flock of paroquets, some
knee deep in the water, others squatting on the bank,
amongst them many negresses with their short hair twisted
into innumerable small plaits across their foreheads. I
thought them to be Nubians, from their features and dark
colour and the style of their hair dressing.</p>

<p>One came up to where I was painting, a tall, good-looking
girl, very black, carrying herself with the graceful nonchalance
of her race. A flat basket laden with newly washed
clothes was on her head, and she stood comely as a statue,
backed by the tawny sand and the dark green of the oasis,
the firm outline of her shoulders and breast showing through
the blue stuff drawn round her. Heavy silver anklets
clashed as she moved. When near me she smiled and said
something in Arabic. Mansour, translating into French,
said she asked where I came from, and if I would take her
as a servant with me to England. I had a swift vision of
the scandalised horror with which my Devon household
would view her arrival in the character of maid. “Tell
her,” I said, “that she would not like England. There is
not enough sun there. She would be cold and unhappy.”
But still she smiled. I gave her a coin, and she went away
regretfully, walking like a queen, evidently still yearning
for the post of lady’s maid in a land paved with gold and
silver. Whilst I went on with my painting, Mansour told
me these negresses are great travellers. They will cheerfully<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
leave their country and fare into the unknown, and they
make excellent servants. I think the Arabs have no feeling
against the black races.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the Arab women were busy over their washing.
“That girl over there,” remarked the guide, “is my cousin.
I recognise her by the tattoo marks on her leg.” I had been
told that these designs were often peculiar to a family, and
Mansour’s remark seemed to bear this out. Most of the
women were tattooed on the shin as well as on the lip and
forehead, and sometimes on the tip of the nose. They only
made a pretence of veiling themselves when he looked
their way, and I gather that in the south of Tunisia the
harem system is not very rigidly enforced. They seemed
very happy, laughing and gossiping amongst themselves,
spreading out broad strips of coloured stuff, red or orange
or indigo, on the stones to dry, whilst the bright hues were
reflected in the clear green water, and small brown children
in abbreviated shifts played solemnly close at hand.</p>

<p>“Never do women cease talking together whilst they
wash linen at the water’s edge,” said Mansour, “and it is
strange how barely one day can pass without something
requiring to be cleansed,” he added meditatively.</p>

<p>Behind us were the low mud walls of the village, with the
towers of the minaret and the domed mosque rising above
them, and a flock of black lop-eared goats came round the
corner driven by a ragged youth. On the far side of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
stream countless palms were inter-threaded with the
branches of fruit trees, and in and out amongst the oasis
ran little dusty roads between mud walls topped with
thorns or spiked palm leaves, to keep off trespassers. By
every path flowed runnels of clear water, pied wagtails
stepped daintily about the edges, a film of green showed
where the early crops were beginning to come up, and I
could picture to myself the joy it must be in another month
or two to step from the bare desert into this paradise of
blossom and leafy shade.</p>

<p>Riding through the oasis one day we came suddenly
upon a small white marabou or holy tomb set at the angle
of two pathways. A solitary figure knelt in prayer at the
entrance, whilst the mule he had been riding cropped the
herbage by the stream, with a trailing rein. It was very
silent, except for the far sighing of the palm trees above
our heads.</p>

<p>Slowly we went on our way and came to a small village
as the afternoon was growing late. The notched stems of
date palms were like purple grey pillars on one side of the
path, and an old man was coming back from work in the
fields, his sand-coloured burnous slung round him in such
fashion as to make a sack in which he was carrying a bunch
of green vegetables. His sinewy neck and arms looked
almost copper colour in the evening light; the faded blue
of his coat repeated the note given by a wisp of smoke that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
floated across a low wall. The dust lay thick on the road,
muting the footfall of passers-by. Already the shadows
were growing long, draped figures were collecting round
the well to draw the evening supply of water. In the
distance was the cloud of dust that meant the return of
the village herd with his flock from their day’s pasturage,
whilst outside the low building where coffee was sold and
drunk, men swathed in the long folds of their burnous sat
and discussed the happenings of the day. And again I
felt the simplicity and dignity of the East.</p>

<p>As we came back across the wide stretches beyond the
oasis, it turned cold and clear. There was hardly a tinge
of colour in the sky till the golden line of the sun had
almost disappeared. Then it was as if the dark hawk of
night had flown upon the bright day. The whole of the
West was littered with tiny golden feathers torn from his
breast, whilst the sky was dyed a sudden red with blood.
The distant palms stood out black as velvet against the
brilliant background, and as it faded, fingers of light
stretched far into the pale green-blue of the heavens.
Then as quickly as the effect had come, it was gone. The
landscape turned a steely grey and the trees a blur of dull
green. Only the strip of sea in the distance kept its
intensity of colour in a world that seemed all at once sucked
empty of life.</p>

<p>From Gabès one can go by car to see Matmata, a village<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
about two hours’ run from the former place, where all the
inhabitants live under ground. The road led across
stretches and stretches of bare sandy country, tufted here
and there with low bushes, across rocky nullahs which
become raging torrents after rain, till at last it climbed
up and up a zigzag road and reached the top of a summit
from whence we looked down on nothing but further and
further bare hills. Below us lay the village, a crumpled
succession of irregularities in the uneven ground. It
looked as if some giant child had been playing in the sand
with a spade.</p>

<p>On getting nearer we saw entrances here and there in
the banks to which were fitted rough wooden doors. We
went into one and found ourselves first in a hollowed
passage which led through a stable to an open space on to
which opened two or three caves in which the inhabitants
lived. They are scooped out by tools and are large and
roomy, with smooth walls and roof worked with a kind of
plaster. Each room contained a large rough wooden bed,
a shelf or two along the wall, perhaps a child’s cradle
swung on ropes from the ceiling. They were all scrupulously
swept and clean. In one a woman sat on the floor nursing
a baby, in another one was weaving rough cloth on a loom.
We also saw an underground café which was full of men,
though from outside there was no sign of life.</p>

<p>Tunnelled passages led from one set of dwellings to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
another in some cases, and we went along one to reach a
shop stocked with provisions.</p>

<p>The recent storms had wrought havoc with the architecture
and the villagers were busy building up walls that had
been undermined by the rain. They were of the usual
peasant type and seemed hardworking, cultivating olives
and the small fields from which they reap a laborious crop.
The French head of the gendarmerie told us there were
15,000 of these people, all living underground. The caves
are said to be warm in winter and cool in summer, and they
certainly compared favourably with many native huts.
The cave-dwellers have lived in this fashion from ancient
times, and I am told that Pliny refers to them in his account
of the Roman settlements in Tunisia. Were one to walk
through the neighbourhood one could never guess at the
labyrinth of dwelling places below one’s very feet. But
knock at one of the doors and a furious barking of dogs
warns the hidden inhabitants of the approach of a stranger.
We were fortunate in seeing the womenfolk about their
work, owing to Mansour having troglodyte relations. As
a rule they are hastily concealed on the arrival of visitors,
and I fear that fate befell the more beautiful amongst them
when we appeared, judging by the singularly unattractive
assortment presented for our inspection: a great disappointment,
since I had heard much of the good looks of the
feminine cave dwellers. Those left for us to see comprised<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
an aged beldame covered with wrinkles, a sickly-looking
half-witted girl, and a by no means merry widow. One
can imagine the mixed feeling with which the beauties of
the family receive orders to retire into hiding, baffled
curiosity warring with a natural complacency at being
credited with the possession of dangerous attractions.</p>

<p>On the way back we passed one of the road patrol,
wrapped in a thick cloak from which a rifle stuck out,
riding a weary horse, and carrying the mails. He rides once
a day from the fort at Matmata to Gabès, sign of the law
and order established in the remote country districts, and
midway on his round he passes the other patrol on the
outward way. Were he to be attacked by a gang of robbers
he would be hard put to it to defend himself. But the
people have an awed respect for the power of the law.
When telegraph posts were first set up in the desert to the
south, the inhabitants were ignorant of their use, and the
arrest of an escaped prisoner from the capital as soon as he
reached his native village seemed to them to savour of
the miraculous. “It is thus,” explained the sergeant of
police, “the wire on those posts stretcheth even unto
Tunis, and as a dog, however long his tail, will bite him
that pulleth it, so when we touch the wire, no matter at
what point, the jaws at the other end will bite.”</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI<br />
<span class="smaller">CUSTOMS</span></h2>

<p>As I said before, the position of Arab women in Tunisia is
so different from that which they hold in Europe that it is
difficult for the two races ever to understand one another.
A wife must not speak to her husband in the presence of
her parents or of his. In referring to him in conversation
she must not mention his name, but use a roundabout
method in speaking of him, such as “the master of the
house” or “the father of my children.” She may not
eat or drink in his presence. Usually he takes his meals
with his sons, waited upon by the women folk, who take
their food later by themselves.</p>

<p>Amongst poor people the wife’s lot is a harsh one as all
the work falls upon her, it being below the dignity of her
husband to help her in any way. One often meets a
countryman on a small donkey ambling along the road,
his feet almost trailing in the dust, whilst his docile wife
runs behind laden with the family baby and various
belongings. Of course it may be that he knows exercise
to be good for her health, but if that is the case, he does
not try the recipe himself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span></p>

<p>The rôle of wife is evidently a precarious one. At any
moment she may be repudiated by her husband and for
the most trifling causes. Should he wish to have the
repudiation pronounced by the Kaïd, it is easy to find
some pretext. Wishing to insult his wife outrageously,
he compares her to the back of a person he cannot marry,
saying for instance: “You are no more to me than the
back of my aunt.” To the European mind this does not
seem a very injurious remark, especially if the aunt is a
handsome woman; but it is enough to send the wife in
tears to the nearest Kaïd. She must wait four months to
give her irate husband time to repent and to do the prescribed
penance of fasting two months or feeding sixty
poor persons. In that case his offence would be washed
out. But one quite understands that it is a good deal
easier for him to go on with the repudiation. He probably
has been on short commons since his unfortunate remark,
for an aggrieved wife is not careful over her cooking, and
he does not therefore relish the prospect of a two months’
real fast. On the other hand sixty poor persons would
probably have voracious appetites. So it comes cheaper
to lose his wife. One can imagine many a mild-mannered
man being driven into this position.</p>

<p>To do Mohammed justice, he endeavoured to improve
the lot of wives, and laid down that the sum paid for one
on marriage should be settled upon her. But there is a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
difference between law and custom, and the old custom
still prevails by which the father receives the money.</p>

<p>The head of the family holds a very important position
in a Mussulman household, and is treated with great deference
by his children. A well brought up son never enters
a house in which his father is without asking his permission,
nor does he smoke in his presence or speak to him till
addressed. Adoption is much practised in Tunisia, and
the adopted children are treated in the same way and hold
the same rights as the real ones.</p>

<p>A man must never speak to any woman in the street
even though she be his own wife or mother. He must
even feign not to see these last. It is one of the things that
strikes one most on first visiting a Mohammedan country.
You never see men and women talking or walking together.
The men walk with each other, whilst the few women you
see scutter about in twos and threes, closely veiled. If
in the company of a husband or father they follow behind.</p>

<p>The Arab is very punctilious as to manners; his
courtesy is remarkable, and there are fine gradations of
salutation which it takes some time for the stranger to
grasp. Should a younger man meet an acquaintance
older than himself, he bows with his right hand on his
heart. The elder responds in the same way. A child
greets his master by taking his hand and kissing it, and
then placing it against his own forehead. This same form<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
of obeisance was paid me by women of the poorer classes.
An inferior kisses the turban of the superior. Two people
of equal rank kiss each other’s shoulders, whilst relatives
meeting after a long absence kiss each other on the lips.
Women embrace each other repeatedly when meeting.</p>

<p>No business can be conducted quickly; before approaching
the real subject the weather must be commented upon,
the health of the other enquired into, and that of his wife
under the ambiguous title of his “house” or his “family.”
Compliments must pass and a thousand and one polite
formulas. To plunge into the matter in hand shows ill
breeding of the worst description.</p>

<p>I was sketching one morning from the office of a lawyer
in an oasis village, so had ample scope for watching professional
etiquette. He was sitting cross-legged on the
floor in flowing robes, his stock of small inkbottles, pens
and other awesome implements of his trade ranged carefully
on the clean matting round him, whilst he was
laboriously writing some document from right to left.
A yellow jonquil stuck behind his left ear seemed to me to
bring a perilously burlesque note into the legal atmosphere,
but I found it taken as a matter of course.</p>

<p>When I asked permission to sit in the doorway of
his office, it was given most graciously and he forthwith
sent out for a tiny cup of black coffee which he begged me
to accept. I felt it would be delightful to become a client<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
under these conditions. Why do not the denizens of
Lincoln’s Inn offer us scented coffee, and wear flowers
behind their ears? It would render the making of a will
a pleasant interlude and do much to cheer a drooping
bankrupt. If a yellow jonquil proved a little voyant for a
London complexion, a white one could be substituted, and
how pleasant the flower-bed in the early morning train up
to town!</p>

<p>Whilst I was there a young man appeared in company
of three or four friends, and after removing their shoes
they were shown into the office with great ceremony.
There they all squatted down on the far side of the ink
bottles, and coffee was at once sent for and handed round.
Grave compliments passed backwards and forwards, and
the client praised the well-known acumen and mental
gifts of the lawyer, who in gracefully denying any special
talent, dislodged the jonquil which fell with a flop to the
floor. Picking it up he absentmindedly tucked it in again,
this time over his right ear, and the conversation was
resumed. The state of the crops was discussed, the
probability under the blessing of Allah of a good harvest,
talk of an extension of the railway, etc. I left half an hour
later, wondering whether the young man had called about
the renting of a piece of agricultural land, but heard later
that he was about to sue a neighbour for debt. Doubtless the
real reason of his interview was reached by the afternoon.</p>

<p>In Tunis itself the women veil themselves in a particularly
ugly way. They bind two thick pieces of black stuff across
their faces, leaving only a slit for the eyes free. In their
voluminous white draperies, and with the white head
covering, this gives a most uncanny appearance. They
look some dreadful kind of grub. Below the full skirts
can be caught a glimpse of stockinged ankles and heelless
slippers surmounted by silver bangles.</p>

<p>They may only unveil before their husbands, fathers
and very near male relations. The Koran has a deep
distrust of feminine charms. “As soon as a man seeth
the eyes of a woman he is running into danger. For the
glance of a woman is as an arrow without bow or cord.”
And again “How often do the looks cast upon women
return to do harm to those who sent them.”</p>

<p>In this leisurely land it is considered bad form to hurry,
this being one of the signs by which those possessed of
devils can be readily detected. Since the opening of
tourist agencies, there has been a great influx of these
latter into the country.</p>

<p>With that care for hygiene so noticeable in ancient
religions, there are countless observances of cleanliness
imposed upon the faithful. Hands must be washed after
a meal, and the face as well before prayer. If water is
not available then fine sand may take its place. Five
prayers must be said daily: in the morning, just before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
sunrise, at midday, during the afternoon, at sunset, and
an hour and a half after the going down of the same. The
call to prayer can be heard at these stated times, and it is
curiously impressive to wake just as dawn is about to
break, and to hear the long drawn-out wail of the muezzin
from the minaret in the silence of the night.</p>

<p>Contact with Western civilisation is loosening the hold
of their religion upon the people of Tunisia, and the change
is probably not for the better. A devout follower of the
law of the Prophet is an upright man, but in the slackening
of his faith he is apt to acquire only the vices of the European
and is in danger of losing his own religion and being left
with nothing to take its place.</p>

<p>There are religious schools as well as the Government
ones where French is taught, and many boys attend
both. In walking through the narrow streets one often
hears the drone of small voices, and sees a neat row of
little slippers outside a doorway. On going inside, one
finds a master intoning the Koran, each phrase of it being
repeated interminably by the scholars sitting cross-legged
on the matting and rocking themselves backwards and
forwards. Each pupil is provided with a board painted
white on which the text is written, and when at last all
the scholars know it by heart it is washed out, and a fresh
one inscribed and taught.</p>

<p>In one tiny village on the edge of the Sahara the school<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
was being held in the courtyard of the minaret, up which
I had gone to see the view. The master was intoning the
Koran in an inner room, whilst the class of small boys
followed it with the correct prostrations outside, facing a
sort of recess in the wall which indicated the direction of
Mecca. They withstood the intense temptation to stare
at a stranger, and went on solemnly with their devotions,
whilst I took a snapshot from behind them, quite
unperceived.</p>

<p>Service is held in the mosques on Fridays, the prayers
being led by a kind of priest called the ‘iman.’ Women
are not allowed to take part in public worship. Friday
is always a busy and crowded day in the Souks, as it is
then that the countrymen come in from the outlying
districts to attend service.</p>

<p>Charity is strictly enjoined on the faithful, and
apparently no one need ever starve in Tunis. He has but
to sit in the gutter and call for alms in the name of Allah,
and he will be supported, even if meagrely, for life. Every
mosque possesses its clientèle of beggars who reap a livelihood
from the worshippers. Fasts are also observed, and
the big fast of the year is that of Ramadan, which lasts for
a month, during which time not a morsel of food nor a
drop of liquid may be taken between sunrise and sunset.
When Ramadan falls in the hot weather, the pious undergo
real sufferings from thirst.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span></p>

<p>Wine is forbidden to a Moslem, but this prohibition is
now often set aside, especially amongst the younger generation.
Probably the drinking of coffee took its place, for
the Arab swallows innumerable tiny cups of it during the day.</p>

<p>The Tunisian café in a small town or village is a pleasant
place. The customers sip their coffee in a leisurely way,
sitting in the sunshine, and discussing the news of the day.
Many play dominoes or chess, and sometimes strolling
musicians, snake-charmers or professional story tellers
collect a group round them. The teller of tales is a very
popular personage, and is always sure of a large audience,
and now and again one comes across the impromptu bard
who weaves his chant as he goes along, introducing apt
stanzas about each giver of a coin, to the delight of the
crowd.</p>

<p>Life is leisurely. No one is in a hurry, the day is long.
Why trouble to do to-day what may as well be left till
to-morrow? There is none of the feverish activity and
restlessness of modern civilisation. “About each man’s
neck hath Allah hung his fate,” and therefore it is useless
to try to avert it. Interminable discussions are carried
on over the coffee cups, and as in village-life all the world
over, a neighbour’s affairs are of only secondary importance
to one’s own. The fierce light that beats upon a throne is
but a taper to the penetrating beam focussed upon every
household in a small community.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span></p>

<p>They are an attractive race, and the poorer classes seem
to have the virtues and faults of children. They require
constant supervision at their work and plenty of the syrup
of praise when they do well, and like children they are
quick to see and take advantage of any weakness in an
employer. George Washington would have found himself
lonely indeed amongst them, for they cannot speak the
truth. They lie as a matter of course and often most
inartistically. A servant will deny that he has been
smoking, even with the half-consumed cigarette between
his fingers. When it is pointed out to him he professes
extreme astonishment and declares that Allah must surely
have placed it there. It is difficult to receive such an
excuse with calm. They are said to be untrustworthy,
but I was not in the country long enough to be able to
judge of this. Their dignity is admirable, they are gentle,
charitable to the poor and treat the aged with reverence.
They love flowers, scent, the shade of trees and the sound
of running water. Missionaries say the children are very
quick and intelligent up to the age of thirteen or fourteen
when their minds seem to cease developing. If they make
some impression on the girls when young, the influence of
fathers and husbands tends quickly to destroy it. Education
is looked on far more favourably than it was, however,
and even the daughters of a family are now sometimes
allowed to attend school, especially in the towns.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span></p>

<p>There are two opposing opinions as to the people of
Tunisia. One side holds that they are a played-out race,
of whom no further development can be expected. The
other declares that their evolution was arrested by the
triumph of Mohammedanism, that in earlier days there
were brilliant intellects amongst them and that there is
every possibility of an awakening of their slumbering
mentality. The French scientist Saint Paul is of this
latter belief. He was for years in the country living amongst
the people and penetrating to their houses in his character
of doctor, and in his book <cite>Souvenirs de Tunisie</cite> published
in 1909 he made an exhaustive study of their psychology
and testified warmly to their good qualities and intelligence.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XII">CHAPTER XII<br />
<span class="smaller">TUNIS</span></h2>

<p>The town of Tunis itself is cosmopolitan. Approached by
steamer, it spreads itself out in a white fan along the edge
of a lagoon that has the effect of a bay, being only divided
from the Gulf of Tunis by the merest strip of land. There
seems scarcely a finger’s breadth between the two. In the
early morning of a December day the town showed as a
white blur in the haze that hung about the lake. The ship
glided slowly through the narrow entrance at Goulette
which leads into a canal deepened out in the shallow
waters of the lagoon, marked on one side by floating buoys
and on the other fringed by the narrow embankment on
which runs the tramway to Carthage.</p>

<p>At first sight Tunis seems knee-deep in water she stands
so low, and indeed a great part of the modern town is built
on land reclaimed from the lake itself. But as one nears
the shore the picturesque jumble resolves itself into flat-topped
white houses, the domes of innumerable mosques,
outlines of minarets, lines of dark foliage marking the
whereabouts of central boulevards, and behind them all
the wooded slopes of the Belvedere pleasure park. From
here the eye is led by degrees to further and further hills.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
It is a picturesque setting. Backed by jagged rocky hills
that glow deep rose and dusky purple at sunset, the capital
gazes over the placid waters of the lake to the deep blue of
the Gulf beyond, to the twin peaks of le Bou-Cornine on
the north east and the low hill of Carthage to the West.</p>

<p>The French part of the town has broad streets with
shady avenues of trees, modern shops with Paris goods
displayed behind plate glass windows. Electric trams pass
and re-pass. One could imagine oneself in the South of
France. But by way of the archway called La Porte de
France, left standing when the ancient walls were
demolished, one escapes with a sigh of relief into the native
town. Here too, everything is touched with Europeanism,
but enough remains to prick the imagination. The narrow
covered Souks or arcades, where the merchants sit in their
tiny raised shops, their shiny yellow slippers ranged side
by side ready to put on again when business is over, the
crowd in flowing Eastern robes sauntering up and down
languidly shopping, the red and green tomb of a holy man
right in the gangway, with a blind beggar squatting beside
it proffering an open hand for alms, the strange chrysalis-shaped
white bundles with their tight black veils, that are
women, the passing funeral with its swathed corpse carried
shoulder-high and followed by a chanting crowd. All this
breathes the East.</p>

<p class="caption">Tunis</p>
<p class="caption">I. M. D.</p>
<p class="caption">2.23.</p>
</div>

<p>And yet the flavour of it is spoilt by the touch of unreality<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
about it all. Tawdry European goods are presided over by
a dignified Mussulman in a fez who will perhaps accost you
in excellent English. From under flowing robes appear
narrow French shoes. One groans. And then, of a sudden,
you may look up an alley way, and it is the real thing
again. A strip of blue sky, hot sunshine, the blue-green
of a small dome, men in statuesque drapery outside the
carved entrance of a mosque. A glimpse within of kneeling
silent figures in white, in dove colour, in grey. And your
flagging spirit fires again. Tunis is a beautiful Arab woman
in European dress, and as such she frequently puts one’s
teeth on edge. But push into the country and you will find
the native life untouched, the peasant people leading the
same lives as generations before them led, no hint of the
uneasy modernism that spoils the capital.</p>

<p>One must remember too that the town of Tunis cannot
be treated as a homogeneous entity. It is composed of
many elements, all keeping to their own customs and
habits and mixing not at all. The French took over the
Protectorate of the country in 1881, but their race does
not predominate here. There is an immense population of
Jews who inhabit their own quarter, and an even greater
number of Italians and Maltese as well as the natives of
the country itself. One hears Italian spoken as often in
the street as French, and I suspect a certain jealousy and
suspicion on the part of the French.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span></p>

<p>The country is ruled by a Bey under the protection of
the French Government represented by a Resident General.
The different provinces are under the management of Kaïds
appointed by the Bey and answerable to French ‘Contrôleurs Civils.’
The system seems to work well, and
undoubtedly the country has prospered under French
protection, even though that protection was originally
thrust upon her. Good roads are made, a plentiful supply
of water is brought to each town, the country is linked up
by railways and telegraphic communication, and schools
are opened in even the smallest places. It seemed to me
the inhabitants live on happy terms with their ‘protectors,’
and I was struck by the absence of any insolence in the
attitude of the latter to the dark-skinned races. Arabs and
Europeans travel in the same railway carriages and trams,
sit perhaps at adjoining tables in restaurants, take their
turn at the booking offices, naturally and without resentment
on either side. I had known India well many years
ago, and the difference of our attitude to a subject race
could not but come into my mind now. The British rule
is a beneficent one, and just. But it is the rule of a kindly
master over subordinates. The French method appears to
me a happier one.</p>

<p>The town of Tunis itself seems to be spreading rapidly,
large hotels spring up as suddenly as mushrooms after a
night’s rain, and the streets are full of sight-seeing tourists.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
At times a cargo of as many as five hundred of them may
be dumped on shore, earnestly ‘doing’ Tunis in a few hours
or a day and a half. The town Arab adapts himself to
his environment and becomes one of that race of beings
without nationality, familiar to all who have travelled in
distant lands, a hybrid creature of most distasteful qualities.
Where the carcase is to be found there shall the vultures
be gathered together, and as the troops of admiring tourists
debouch upon the street one is irresistibly reminded of a
shoal of herring in shallow water with its accompanying
clamour of predatory gulls. If Allah has caused the harvest
to fail, he has at least provided the tourist.</p>

<p>They are of all varieties: from the superior person
sheltered from any contact with the vulgar world behind
the glass windows of his touring limousine-car, and the
crowd that moves from one cosmopolitan hotel to another,
carried about almost without volition like goldfish in a
bowl, to the traveller who perhaps has saved up enough
just to do a Mediterranean trip and to stare with delighted
bewilderment at a life so different from that to which he
is accustomed.</p>

<p>In the hotel of one small oasis town I observed a tall and
gaunt young man of indeterminable nationality, and as I
rode back peacefully in the evening from my saunters in
search of sketchable points of view I used to see the same
youth striding along the road, the dust flying from behind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
his heels, whilst a weary guide tottered in his wake.
Mansour was much amused. “Truly the foreigner is
possessed of a devil,” he remarked, “I know his guide and he
tells me that every day his employer sets forth with a map
and walks with fury from the rising up of the sun to its
going down. He is afflicted with a rage of walking.
Mahmoud when first engaged by him rejoiced greatly, for
he thought the newcomer to be inexperienced and foresaw
fat profit for himself. But though it is but four days since
he came, already is my friend so greatly exhausted that
he can scarce put one foot before the other. He prays
daily that the stranger may soon leave, for he is so young
that there is still great strength in him. He is tall and his
legs are of such a length that he takes but one step while
Mahmoud must take two, and never will he take a car
or mount a donkey.”</p>

<p>We were gently ambling home from a sketching expedition.
It was getting late in the afternoon and the long
shadows of the palms lay across the sandy road. Our
steeds were beginning to mend their pace as they came in
sight of their stables. I had been painting hard and was in
the comfortably tired state induced by two hours satisfactory
work. Suddenly there was the sound of footsteps
and there shot past us the figure of the thin young man
walking as if for a wager. His brow was unheated, his
face serene. Close behind him panted the sorry figure of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
Mahmoud who cast an agonised look upon his friend as
he limped past. His figure was certainly not adapted to
violent exercise and he seemed at the last stages of
exhaustion. And so he was. Next day the energetic
pedestrian passed me where I sat sketching down by the
river. The dust still spurted from below his feet. But
he was alone. “Mahmoud hath taken to his bed,”
explained Mansour, “he saith that if he gets up he will be
made to walk fifteen miles. And indeed he cannot rise
for he is naught but aches and pains from head to foot and
is calling curses upon the foreigner. He had hoped to be
given much money, for had he not ready two pairs of
worn-out shoes to testify for him? But is not life sweeter
than money? and he can do no more. The traveller has
not been able to get another guide, for every man finds
himself of a sudden too busy. Thus he will soon leave.
And Mahmoud saith that never will he engage himself
from henceforth to any stranger till he has first looked
upon him to see whether or no his legs be long!”</p>

<p>In Tunis, forgetting that I myself was a tourist, I studied
them with an interested eye. Sitting outside a small
restaurant in the central boulevard where the heaped
flower stalls made splashes of colour under the heavy
foliage of the trees, I watched them pass, sipping my coffee
and meditating their infinite variety.</p>

<p>And in the hotel drawing room that evening I was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
accosted by a grey haired and aggrieved spinster. “Can
you tell me,” she asked, “where I can find a tea-shop in
Tunis?” I explained patiently that tea-shops are not
indigenous to the country, that tea can be served at any
café or restaurant, but that coffee is the national drink
and is beautifully made. “In a town of this size there <em>must</em>
be a tea-shop,” she remarked firmly, “I mean the kind
where there is a band and you can get muffins and scones
as well as cakes. I am sure someone told me there <em>is</em>
one here,” she added, casting a suspicious glance upon me.
I mentally shrugged my shoulders and moved away.
She spent three days in the place and every afternoon
was devoted to her pathetic quest. And on the last day
as she stood in the hall awaiting the hotel omnibus, her
luggage about her feet and a neat waterproof upon her
arm, I ventured to inquire as to its success. “I was here
too short a time to come across it,” she answered coldly,
“but I shall be returning.”</p>

<p>So I gather the search for a tea-shop is to be resumed,
and I am very much afraid that in a year or two she may
find it.</p>

<p>The history of Tunisia has been the record of a long
sequence of civilisations that have possessed her in turn,
have risen to fame and glory and one by one have gone
down before a fresh power. As far back as the ninth
century <span class="smcapuc">B.C.</span>, Carthage was founded by the Phœnicians<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
and rapidly became a rich and powerful city. Her merchants
trafficked all along the Mediterranean and even
pushed as far as the little island of Great Britain wrapped
in Atlantic fogs. Her riches were immense and she dared
to enter the lists against Rome itself. This temerity cost
her dear. After two long wars she was beaten, her fleet
destroyed, and finally in 146 <span class="smcapuc">B.C.</span> the Romans utterly
destroyed the town, and the country became a Roman
province. They rebuilt it later and Carthage again became
rich and powerful. In 439 <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> she was taken by the
Vandals and about a hundred years later passed into the
keeping of the Byzantine Empire. At the end of the seventh
century the city was again utterly destroyed by Arab
conquerors, and since then Carthage has remained a heap
of ruins, the town of Tunis gradually growing in importance
and wealth. The subsequent fortunes of the country
since the Arab conquest down to 1575 were interwoven
with the general history of Barbary, but at that date it
was conquered by the Ottoman Empire, till it threw off
the Turkish yoke about the eighteenth century and became
virtually independent. Finally, in 1881, France sent an
expedition to Tunis with the proclaimed purpose of punishing
the raids of Tunisian tribes into Algiers, and eventually
the Bey, under compulsion, signed a treaty of suzerainty
to the French Republic.</p>

<p>As each of the earlier conquerors in turn tried busily to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
destroy all vestiges of his predecessor’s reign, little else
but fragments are left of the older civilisations. Carthage
is not even a heap of ruins now. She is a handful of dust.
Her stones were carried away for the construction of Arab
houses, one comes across stray pillars wreathed with the
acanthus of Rome, in the Souks of Tunis, huge blocks of
stone are built even into the mud villages everywhere,
marble pillars have been transferred bodily into the interiors
of mosques. Carthage herself has become a desolation
and a waste.</p>

<p>I went there on a day of hot sunshine and an intense
blue sky. It is about ten miles from Tunis. As the train
crawled like a caterpillar along the thread of embankment
across the lagoon, an Italian steamer was gliding through
the canal on my right; and beyond the pencilled edge of
the lake was the deep blue rim of sea for which she was
bound. On my left was the placid surface of the lake,
dotted with waterfowl and with a few wooden stakes here
and there, on which crouched the black figures of cormorants
looking like dejected priests. On a tiny island were the
ruins of a Spanish fort. Reaching Goulette, there were
still a few small stations to pass, and then came Carthage.</p>

<p>The sandy soil seemed almost to throb in the warmth,
hedges of cactus lined the broad road from the tiny station.
Absurd modern villas stood about, flotsam of the new
civilisation. But climbing upward I left the villas behind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
and turning on the slopes looked out to where the blue
of the sea faded into a soft haze. To the west the red cliffs
of Sidi bou Said caught the eye, and the clustering white
houses of its beautiful village. On the summit of the hill
of Carthage stands the ugly modern Roman Catholic
cathedral, avenging by its presence the deaths of Saint
Perpetua and the unfortunately named poor little Saint
Felicity, Christian martyrs in the Roman amphitheatre
of Carthage.</p>

<p>Adjoining the cathedral is the monastery of the Pères
Blancs, who have a small museum filled with Punic and
Roman remains. There are fragments of statues, broken
vases, earthenware lamps, coins, medals, sarcophagi in
which one can see frail skeletons preserved in their covering
of aromatic gum. These haughty warriors and princesses
lie helplessly exposed to the gaze of every idle tourist, the
painted lids of their resting places standing sentinel-fashion
behind each. I am no antiquarian. All I carried away
was a confused impression of a débris washed up on the
shores of Time; of delicate bracelets and gold rings, of
tiny charms, of iridescent glass bottles dug up from the
sand, of all the odds and ends that human beings gather
round them. I think they were not so very different from
ourselves, these people of long ago. And now conquerors
and conquered mingle their remains in the sterile peace of
museum shelves. In the garden outside were ranged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
pieces of pillars, fragments of vast statues, here a giant
hand, there a colossal head.</p>

<p>A white-robed monk paced slowly along the path with
his breviary, and a bush of rosemary gave out a faint
aromatic scent as my skirts brushed it in passing. A
small boy was herding a flock of goats by the shattered
ruins of the amphitheatre, and I wandered from one group
of stones to another, all that was left of a great and famous
city. I was shown fragments of Roman villas with mosaic
pavements, private entrances from them to the theatre
where only a broken column or two remains to show the
glories of what had once been. Nearly all the finds of any
value have been taken to the Bardo Museum at Tunis.
Here there is almost nothing. A soft wind stirred the grass
growing between the blocks of fallen masonry, a tiny
lizard ran swiftly across one of the grey stone seats, far off
in the gentian blue of the Gulf showed a feather of dark
smoke. The silence was so intense that one could almost
hear the rustle of the lizard’s feet. One’s mind swung
giddily backwards through the past centuries. More than
ever one had the sensation of the inexorable tide of Time,
carrying into oblivion the painfully acquired civilisations
of the world. Each so absorbed, so confident, and of them
all what is left? The crumbling fragile bones in the
museum, and a tiny chip of blue mosaic in the dust at my
feet, seemed the only answer.</p>
